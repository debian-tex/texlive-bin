  Bad lines are:
  0 GpPBeg
  NP
  129 400 m 4629 400 l 4629 6400 l 129 6400 l CP
  eoclip
  1 1 1 SC
  NP
  128 400 m 4629 400 l 4629 6400 l 128 6400 l CP
  AF
  GSE
  To avoid the white rectangle deleting all the text above,
  it is sufficient to delete
  "1 1 1 SC" to "AF", however, I used eoclip as indicator
  for the whole sequence.
----------------------------
revision 1.37 (not released)
date: 2001/10/10
- added "/setpagedevice {pop} def" to prolog in order to fix
  problems with pdf creation, pstricks and nested dvips output

----------------------------
revision 1.34 (not released)
-------------
date: 2001/08/20 12:38:22

- Improved processing of files with embedded binary coded images

----------------------------
revision 1.32 (not released)
-------------
date: 2001/04/06 22:31:27
- Fixed case sensitiveness when checking for suffix replacement
  (thanks to Erik Jørgensen)
----------------------------
revision 1.31
-------------
date: 2001/02/27 19:45:19
- Heuristic added for finding end of file by counting %%EOF comments.
  Now correctly treats already embedded EPS, too.
  Usually only trailing garbage (e.g., PCL control sequences) follows
  last %%EOF. However, sometimes the last %%EOF may be missing.
  Therefore, the behavior is switchable by new -E option.
----------------------------
revision 1.30 (not released)
-------------
date: 2001/02/09 16:55:32
Just forgot the new options in usage line, corrected year in copyright

----------------------------

date: 2000/10/13 09:51:55
\n was missing at altered clipping bounding box
----------------------------
revision 1.27 (not released)
date: 2000/10/13 09:39:07
Clip option should now also print the enlarged BoundingBox in the
Postscript header, so it is not cut off if it gets clipped again.
----------------------------
revision 1.26
- just fixed the E-Mail address, because it will not change so often
  in the future
----------------------------
revision 1.25 (not released)
- new -C option clipping added
- fixed page bounding box search message
