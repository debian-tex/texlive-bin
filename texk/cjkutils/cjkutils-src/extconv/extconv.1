.SH NAME
extconv \- convert a TeX document in either Big\ 5+ or GBK encoding into
`preprocessed' form.
.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B extconv
<
.I infile
>
.I outfile
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Big\ 5+ and GBK encodings use the characters
.C { ,
.C } ,
and
.C \e
which have special meanings in \*(TX
documents.
.PP
After processing a \*(LE
document which contains such characters with
.B \%extconv
you need not care about these special characters.
.PP
This filter is part of the
.B CJK
macro package for \*(LE.
