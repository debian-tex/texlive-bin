	Building t1lib-5.1.2 as part of the TL tree
	=============================================

This directory libs/t1lib/ uses a proxy Makefile.am to build the t1lib library
from the unmodified(*) source tree in libs/t1lib/t1lib-x.y.z/, bypassing
the original build system.

As far as applicable, the tests in libs/t1lib-x.y.z/configure.in have been
copied to libs/t1lib/configure.ac.

-----------------------------

(*) almost unmodified,  the file lib/t1lib/t1lib.h has been removed!

=============================
