Development of ChkTeX is now in a maintainance mode. All versions
after 1.6 are essentially bug fixes.

1.6.6 (2012-04-07), released by Ivan Andrus <darthandrus@gmail.com>

  * Fixed some memory issues
  * Do not increase line number when the line was very long
  * Some fixes for TexLive

1.6.5 (??), released by Jean-Marc Lasgouttes <lasgouttes@lyx.org>

  * Fix bug where ChkTeX generates a warning about missing space before
    parenthesis when the parenthesis is at start of line.
  * Update ChkTeX.tex.in to use proper LaTeX2e markup.
  * Update the build machinery a bit.

1.6.4 (2007-10-20), released by Baruch Even

  * For some reason 1.6.3 did not include all the changes it was supposed to
    have, this release should fix it. One such issue is the MacOS X
    compilation.
  * Include some updates to the default chktexrc from Jean-Marc Lasgouttes.

1.6.3, released by Baruch Even

  * Support DESTDIR for installation to help distributions.
  * Apply old standing patch from Jean-Marc Lasgouttes to compile outside the
    directory.
  * Enable compilation on MacOS X.
  * Fix various coding issues.


Original versions from Jens T. Berger Thielemann:
=================================================

Modifications and additions since v1.6:

  * Improved the build system
  * Better fixes for memory access errors

Modifications and additions since v1.5:

  * Fixed a crash when running from emacs
  * Fixed a crash when checking our own manual
  * Added \verb* support

Modifications and additions since v1.4:

 ** New warnings

  * No space or similar in front/after parenthesis.
  * Demands a consistent quote style.
  * Double spaces in input which will not be rendered as one.
  * Punctuation malplaced regarding to math mode.
  * Warns about TeX primitives.
  * Space in front of footnotes.
  * Bogus \left and \right commands.

 ** Program

  * The abbreviation recognizer has (for the last time?) been
    redesigned. We now produce far less false warnings, catch more
    cases and do all this faster than before. Seems like a win. Done
    much of the same with the italic correction detection part,
    too.
  * Some bugs have been silently fixed. Hot spots in the program have
    been optimized; in certain cases this in fact doubles the speed!
  * Along with this goes more code elegance and utilization of macro
    processing and the C language. Take a look at Resource.[ch].

  * It's possible to specify separate output-formats depending on
    whether you are sending the output to a file/pipe or to a
    terminal.

  * Column positions are finally correct; we now expand tabs
    correctly.
  * ChkTeX will now recursively search for \input'ed
    files, both in the document and on the commandline. See the
    chktexrc file for more info.
  * The debug switch is now more intelligent; if you wish to hack
    a bit on ChkTeX for yourself, it is possible to produce
    selective debugging output. The feature can also be disabled
    altogether.
  * MS-DOS and OS/2 version of the program is now more flexible
    and well-behaved, thanks to Gerd Boehm.
  * You may now say -wall to make all messages warnings, and
    turn them on.
  * Uses termcap on UNIX boxes; this should ensure that -v2
    (or more precisely: %i and %I works regardless to
    what terminal you are using.

 ** Resource file

  * You may now specify both case-sensitive and case-insensitive user
    patterns in the chktexrc file. In addition; it is now possible to
    reset/clear lists.
  * You can now specify how many optional or required arguments
    WIPEARG should wipe; it also behaves somewhat more intelligently
    when the arguments stretch over multiple lines.
  * Global files will be read in addition to local ones. The searching
    order has also been reversed in order to make this more
    intelligent.

 ** Other

  * The documentation has been polished and should now be easier
    to use in practical situations.
  * check target in Makefile, so you can check that the installation
    succeeded. In fact, the Makefile has been enhanced in several other
    ways too, amongst other it is now GNU conforming.
  * deweb is now documented; you may say "man deweb" to get a few
    words of advice. The support script (chkweb) does now behave as the
    remaining package (accepting stdin input and flags).
  * I've written an Emacs hack which magically adds ChkTeX to the list
    of AUC-TeX commands; thus making the use of the program even more
    trivial. For those of you who don't wish to mess with Emacs, I've
    included a trivial lacheck <-> ChkTeX interface. This means that you
    now can use ChkTeX just as easily as lacheck when you're running
    AUC-TeX.
  * Added an ARexx script which lets ChkTeX talk to VBrowse, the
    message browser of Volker Barthelmann's freely distributable ANSI
    C compiler. The browser itself is available on Aminet as
    dev/c/vbcc.lha.
