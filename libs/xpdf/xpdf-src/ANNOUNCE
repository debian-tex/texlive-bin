Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xpdf 4.00 - a PDF viewer and related tools

Glyph & Cog, LLC is pleased to announce a new version of Xpdf, the
open source Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer.  The Xpdf project
also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and
various other utilities.

*** The Xpdf web site has moved to www.xpdfreader.com ***

Xpdf uses the Qt toolkit and runs on Linux and Windows.  The
non-graphical components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) run on Linux,
Unix, Windows, MacOSX, and pretty much any other system with a decent
C++ compiler.

Major changes:
* Complete rewrite of the xpdf GUI, using Qt instead of Motif.
* Multithreaded rasterization in the viewer - pages are now rasterized
  in a separate thread so that scrolling and other UI activity is not
  blocked.
* Added a linear text selection mode.

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list of changes.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for Linux and Windows.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page:
