1. What is `ptexenc'?

  `ptexenc' is a useful library for Japanese pTeX
(which stands for publishing TeX, and is an extension of
TeX by ASCII Co.) and its surrounding tools.
`ptexenc' provides a better way of handling character encodings.

  `ptexenc' is not an official product of ASCII Co.,
so pTeX and other tools need some patches to make use of it.
Some patches are included within this archive.

  `ptexenc' was derived from pTeX first,
and then added some extensions by N. Tsuchimura
with help of T. Tanaka.
Its license is modified BSD (same as pTeX).

2. Outline

  Typically, we need TeX Live 2008 to install `ptexenc.'
`ptexenc' depends on kpathsea and the directory structure
of TeX Live 2008.

  As `ptexenc' is a mere library,
application users will not be conscious of it,
but software developers will be blessed with it.  
It's because they can simplify the sources
with separating the character coding operation.
However, many applications do not have `ptexenc' support now,
we supply patches to the following software as examples:
-- ftp://ftp.ascii.co.jp/pub/TeX/ascii-ptex/tetex/ptex-src-3.1.11.tar.gz
-- ftp://ftp.ascii.co.jp/pub/TeX/ascii-ptex/mendex/mendexk2.6f.tar.gz
-- ftp://ftp.ascii.co.jp/pub/TeX/ascii-ptex/jvf/makejvf-1.1a.tar.gz
  (Note: Some of them are distributed via CTAN,
   but the CTAN version tends to be old.) 

  The patches included in this archive provide `autoconf'
support, too.  This means that installation processes
of those applications are unified, though the installation
processes will differ from the originally documented ones.

  Note: Officially, pTeX stands on the basis of teTeX-3.0,
but not on the basis of TeX Live 2008.  We solve this problem,
i.e., this archive includes a patch on pTeX which adapts
pTeX to TeX Live 2008.

3. How to install

(1) Extract `texlive-20080816-source.tar.lzma' of TeX Live 2008.

(2) Extract ptexenc-*.tar.lzma and ptex-src-*.tar.gz, etc.
    Rename their directory names exactly as bellow.

  texk/ptexenc         <= ptexenc-*
  texk/web2c/ptexdir   <= ptex-src-*
  texk/mendexk         <= mendexk*  (optional)
  texk/makejvf         <= makejvf-* (optional)

(3) Excute "./ptexenc/patches/texlive2008.sh" in "texk"
    to apply patches under 'texk/ptexenc/patches' directory.
    The following patches will be applied.
 -- texlive2008-ptexenc.patch
 -- ptex-src-3.1.11-ptexenc.patch
 -- mendexk2.6f-ptexenc.patch
 -- makejvf-1.1a-ptexenc.patch
    (Note: jmpost-0.04b-ptexenc.patch doesn't work now.)

(4) Excute "./Build" script as normal TeX Live 2008.

(5) (optional) Specify your "nkf" command in the last line of
    "$TEXMF/web2c/texmf.cnf" to enable automatic encoding detection.

(6) Extract ptex-texmf-*.tar.gz under $TEXMF.
 -- ftp://ftp.ascii.co.jp/pub/TeX/ascii-ptex/tetex/ptex-texmf-2.5.tar.gz
    (Note: The current version of ptex-texmf-2.5.tar.gz contains
     an extra directory "ptex-texmf". This should be removed.)
