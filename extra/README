Public domain.  Originally written 2010 by Karl Berry.

This directory contains things which are not part of the TeX Live build,
but only present for convenience.

djgpp support here is probably obsolete, but just in case.

epstopdf and jfontmaps are developed here because we didn't feel like 
making a separate repository.

xz-* is here so TL builders can easily get it
