dvipdfmx and xdvipdfmx for TeX Live
===================================

This package is released under the GNU GPL, version 2, or (at your
option) any later version.

dvipdfmx is now maintained as part of TeX Live.

Mailing list for bug reports and all discussion:
https://lists.tug.org/dvipdfmx; anyone can join the list, but it is not
necessary to join to post. Archives are public.

xdvipdfmx
=========
xdvipdfmx is an extended version of dvipdfmx, and is now incorporated in
the same sources.

The extensions provided by xdvipdfmx provide support for the Extended DVI
(.xdv) format used by xetex, including support for platform-native fonts
and the xetex graphics primitives, as well as Unicode/OpenType text.

Like its direct ancestor dvipdfmx, this is free software and may be
redistributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
version 2 or (at your option) any later version.

Jonathan Kew mentions that in the past, XeTeX used a Mac-specific
program xdv2pdf as the backend instead of xdvipdfmx.  xdv2pdf supported
a couple of special effects that are not yet available through
xdvipdfmx: the Quartz graphics-based shadow support, AAT "variation"
fonts like Skia, transparency as an attribute of font color, maybe other
things.  It would be nice for those things to continue to be supported,
if anyone is looking for some nontrivial but not-impossible job and
happens across this file.


1. Introduction
   ------------

   The dvipdfmx (formerly dvipdfm-cjk) project provides an eXtended version
   of the dvipdfm, a DVI to PDF translator developed by Mark A. Wicks.

   The primary goal of this project is to support multi-byte character
   encodings and large character sets for East Asian languages. The secondary
   goal is to support as many features as pdfTeX developed by Han The Thanh.

   This project is a combined work of the dvipdfm-jpn project by Shunsaku
   Hirata and its modified one, dvipdfm-kor, by Jin-Hwan Cho.


2. Installation
   ------------

   Currently, dvipdfmx is distributed as part of TeX Live. For TeX Live users,
   please refer to the following site

     https://www.tug.org/texlive/svn/ 

   for an instruction on how to obtain and build the dvipdfmx program.

3. Random number generating function
   ---------------------------------

   Prefixes of font names are calculated by using a function which
   generates pseudo random numbers. In order to obtain a unique
   prefix on all platforms when current time is common, a special
   function MT19937, coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto,
   is used. The header of the C program by Takuji Nishimura and
   Makoto Matsumoto is the following:

   A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/1/26.
   Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.

   Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)  
   or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).
