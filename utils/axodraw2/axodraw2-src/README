Axodraw2 2.1.1 2018/02/15
=========================

axodraw2.sty version is v2.1.1 2018/02/15
axohelp.c version is 1.2 2018/02/14

Axodraw2 is a package that defines macros for drawing Feynman graphs
in LaTeX documents.

It is an important development from the axodraw package, but since it
is not completely backwards compatible, we have given the style file a
changed name.

Compared with axodraw, many new features have been added, with new
types of line, and much more flexibility in their properties: For
details see the documentation.

In addition, it is now possible to use axodraw2 with pdflatex, as well
as with the latex-dvips method. However with pdflatex (and also
lualatex and xelatex), an external helper program, axohelp, is used to
perform the geometrical calculations needed for the pdf code inserted
in the output file.  The processing involves a run of pdflatex, a run
of axohelp, and then another run of pdflatex.

The files in the distribution are:
