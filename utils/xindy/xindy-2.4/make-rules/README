MAKE-RULES

This package contains the following:

1. A Perl script to transform a description of a (language-specific)
alphabet into a set of sorting rules for xindy. Alphabets for some languages
are also provided.

2. A Perl script to generate sets of rules which are needed in combination
with the LaTeX `inputenc' package.

Requirements:
- TeX and LaTeX
- Perl 5 or higher
- GNU make or an equivalent `make' program
- If your favourite character set is not yet supported: iconv

The sorting rules for each language are described in files
alphabets/*/*.pl. You can check them and change them if necessary.

======================================================================

This is a modified release of the xindy make-rules package.
The modifications were done to integrate it into this overall xindy
source distribution and adapt it to autoconf/automake.

make-rules was written by Thomas Henlich <thenlich _AT_ web.de>, with
contributions by Martin Vermeer <martin.vermeer _AT_ hut.fi>.
The modifications were written by Gour <list _AT_ atmarama.org>.

This release is based on a snapshot that was taken around January 14,
2004. The modifications are only available in this distribution, they
are not (yet) committed to CVS. That's partly because we need to merge
them in, make-rules has changed a bit in CVS.

======================================================================

All autoconf/automake adaptions are released under
GPL version 2, or later.
