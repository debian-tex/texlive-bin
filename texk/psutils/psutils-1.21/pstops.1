.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pstops
rearranges pages from a PostScript document, creating a new PostScript file.
The input PostScript file should follow the Adobe Document Structuring
Conventions.
.I Pstops
can be used to perform a large number of arbitrary re-arrangements of
Documents, including arranging for printing 2-up, 4-up, booklets, reversing,
selecting front or back sides of documents, scaling, etc.
.PP
.I pagespecs
follow the syntax:
.RS
.TP 12
.I pagespecs
.I = [modulo:]specs
.TP
.I specs
.I = spec[+specs][,specs]
.TP
.I spec
.I = [-]pageno[L][R][U][H][V][@scale][(xoff,yoff)]
.RE
.sp
.I modulo
is the number of pages in each block. The value of
.I modulo
should be greater than 0; the default value is 1.
.I specs
are the page specifications for the pages in each block. The value of the
.I pageno
in each
.I spec
should be between 0 (for the first page in the block) and \fImodulo\fR-1
(for the last page in each block) inclusive.
The optional dimensions
.I xoff
and
.I yoff
shift the page by the specified amount.
.I xoff
and
.I yoff
are in PostScript's points, but may be followed by the units
.B "cm"
or
.B "in"
to convert to centimetres or inches, or the flag
.B "w"
or
.B "h"
to specify as a multiple of the width or height.
The optional parameters \fIL\fR, \fIR\fR, \fIU\fR, \fIH\fR and \fIV\fR
rotate the page left, right, or upside-down, and flip (mirror) page
horizontally or vertically.
The optional
.I scale
parameter scales the page by the fraction specified.
If the optional minus sign is specified, the page is relative to the end of
the document, instead of the start.

If page \fIspec\fRs are separated by
.B \+
the pages will be merged into one page; if they are separated by
.B ,
they will be on separate pages.
If there is only one page specification, with
.I pageno
zero, the \fIpageno\fR may be omitted.

The shift, rotation, and scaling are applied
to the PostScript transformation matrix
in that order regardless of which order
they appear on the command line.
The matrix accumulates the individual transformations.
The effect on the image is to first scale with respect to an origin
at the lower left corner, then rotate about the same origin, and
finally shift.
.PP
The
.I \-w
option gives the width which is used by the
.B "w"
dimension specifier, and the
.I \-h
option gives the height which is used by the
.B "h"
dimension specifier. These dimensions are also used (after scaling) to set the
clipping path for each page.
The 
.I \-p
.PP
The
.I \-b
option prevents any
.B bind
operators in the PostScript prolog from binding. This may be needed in cases
where complex multi-page re-arrangements are being done.
.PP
The
.I \-d
option draws a line around the border of each page, of the specified width.
If the \fIlwidth\fR parameter is omitted, a default linewidth of 1 point is
assumed. The linewidth is relative to the original page dimensions,
\fIi.e.\fR it is scaled up or down with the rest of the page.
.PP
Pstops normally prints the page numbers of the pages re-arranged; the
.I \-q
option suppresses this.
.SH EXAMPLES
This section contains some sample re-arrangements. To put two pages on one
sheet (of A4 paper), the pagespec to use is:
.sp
.ce
"2:0L@.7(21cm,0)+1L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)"
.sp
To select all of the odd pages in reverse order, use:
.sp
.ce
2:-0
.sp
To re-arrange pages for printing 2-up booklets, use
.sp
.ce
"4:-3L@.7(21cm,0)+0L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)"
.sp
for the front sides, and
.sp
.ce
"4:1L@.7(21cm,0)+-2L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)"
.sp
for the reverse sides (or join them with a comma for duplex printing).
