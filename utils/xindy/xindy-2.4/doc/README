This directory contains documentation of `xindy'.

Manual pages for the commands are created during installation and are
placed in appropriate man directories.
PDF versions of the manual pages have been added here for your convenience.

The subdirectory ./style-tutorial/ contains the examples that are used
in the xindy style tutorial.

FAQ and style tutorial are out of date. (Updates are welcome, of course.)
You find more documentation at the xindy Web Site, at http://www.xindy.org/.
