	Building libgd-2.1.1 as part of the TL tree
	=========================================

This directory libs/gd/ uses a proxy Makefile.am to build the gd library
from the unmodified source tree in libs/gd/libgd-src/, bypassing the
original build system.

As far as applicable, the tests in libs/gd/libgd-src/configure.ac have
been copied to libs/gd/configure.ac.
