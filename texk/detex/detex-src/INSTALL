To build the program, you need:
* 'make' program
* a C compiler (for example, Clang or GCC)
* 'lex' implementation (for example, flex)

Debian/Ubuntu users can install those by executing:
   sudo apt-get install make gcc flex

To compile the program, simply execute
   make

To install the program, execute
   sudo make install
