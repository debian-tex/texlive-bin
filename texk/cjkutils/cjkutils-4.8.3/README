Welcome to CJK version 4.8.3 (07-May-2012), a LaTeX2e macro package which
enables the use of CJK scripts (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) in various
encodings, written by Werner Lemberg <wl@gnu.org>.

A mailing list exists at cjk@ffii.org; bugs should be sent to
cjk-bug@ffii.org.  To subscribe one of the lists, send a mail with the
subject `subscribe' (without the quotes) to <list>-request@ffii.org, e.g.,
cjk-request@ffii.org.

If you are interested in the process of development you may observe

  http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=cjk.git;a=summary

to see the commitments to the git repository of the CJK package, and which
also provides snapshots.

The home site of the CJK package is

  http://cjk.ffii.org

Additionally, the latest non-development version can be found on all CTAN
hosts and its mirrors in the directory <CTAN>/language/chinese.


The package comes in two parts:

    cjk-4.8.3.tar.gz:       The source files. Needed for all platforms.
    cjk-4.8.3-doc.tar.gz:   Preformatted documentation files: DVI, PS,
                            output from cjk-enc.el, etc.

Note that on CTAN and its mirrors, the `src' archive is unpacked; you must
thus get all files and subdirectories from language/chinese/CJK/.
