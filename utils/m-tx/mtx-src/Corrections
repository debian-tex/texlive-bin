Corrections and enhancements to M-Tx starting from 0.53
=======================================================
   
Newest items at top. You might also want to look at file `MAINTENANCE`.

Version 0.63
------------

1. `Space` can put in optional extra space between title block and 
first stave.
2. Multibar rest may appear after comment lines in its paragraph. (Thanks
to Christian Mondrup for finding the bug.)
3. Spurious error message when using `][` corrected. (Thanks
to Christian Mondrup for finding the bug.)
4. Pickup consisting of rests allowed with multibar rest. (Feature requested
by  Christian Mondrup.)
5. Also recognizes `F` as doubling duration in multiplet. (Feature requested
by  Christian Mondrup.)
6. No longer adds an undesired duration to rests in a multiplet.  (Thanks
to Christian Mondrup for finding the bug.)

Version 0.62c
-------------

1. Emit one `rmN` per stave, rather than only one. This error was
  introduced in Version 0.61a when the multibar coding was streamlined.

Version 0.62b
-------------

1. An error is raised if a cumulative preamble command like TeX grows 
  too long.
2. Typo corrected in Makefile item README.md.

Version 0.62a
-------------

1. Fonts bigtype and BIgtype, needed because PMX header font sizes
were made smaller in July 2015, added to \mtxPalatino. Also, for
completeness, \mtxbigsf and \mtxBIGsf. This version tagged on GitHub
as 0.62.

Version 0.62
------------

1. `\mtxlatex` command no longer needed.
2. Various subtleties in the code have been commented.

Version 0.61a
-------------

1. Special code for multi-bar rests removed, taking advantage of
upstream improvements. 
2. MusiXTeX 1.21 and PMX 2.71 required in `mtx.tex`.
3. When the last line of a file does not have an end-of-line,
its line number in comments and error messages was 0. Corrected now. 
(This bug was almost 11 years old.)

Version 0.61
------------

Mainly aids to the programmer.

1.  `TeX` preamble command for Type 2 TeX strings.
2.  Assertions: Range, Bars.
3.  User's Manual thoroughly revised.
4.  Misnamed procedure `tex3` is now `TeXtype2`.
5.  Page and font macros are included in `mtx.tex`.
6.  The part of this file above the horizontal line is in Markdown.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.60f
  notes.pas: {$V-} inserted since otherwise Pascal 2.6.2 regards it as an 
    error to pass a var argument of type `string[16]` to a procedure that 
    expects type `string`.
  lyrics.pas: tests for empty lyrics paragraph
  
Version 0.60e (RETRACTED)
  Any bar word starting with `|` terminates a pickup, not only `|`.
  Actually the manual was clear on this point, so the current version
  has reverted to 0.60d.

Version 0.60d
  Replaced space character tie label by no label,
  status.pas: procedure labelSlur, call procedure insertchar only for slurs.

Version 0.60c
  Added facility for prefixing music words with '_' for handling in PMX.
  Prefix is stripped in output file.
  mtxline.pas: type music_word, const bind_left, array name, 
	       procedure GetNextMusWord.

Version 0.60b
  Fixed bug in doPMXpreamble causing errors with printed meters.

Version 0.60a 
  Fix for music size 13 in preamble.pas.
  Convert M-Tx denominators '1', '16', '32' and '64' 
  to PMX meter denominator syntax '0', '1', '3' and '6'. 
  {} ties don't get PMX label T attached in order to support MIDI ties.

Planned for the near future
  Accepts detached shortcut.

Version 0.55h (not released)
  Traces pitch including z-words; warns if unreal.  Disable checkPitch
  to bypass this.

Version 0.55g (not released)
  Corrects another bug in notes.pas, introduced at 0.55d.
  Features: countMacro, expandMacro. 

Version 0.55f (not released)
  Corrects bugs, mainly in notes.pas, introduced at 0.55d.
  Help via command line.

Version 0.55e (not released)
  Chord ties.  E.g.  C: {ce cf  ties the c.  No close-tie symbol.

Version 0.55d (not released)
  Mainly code cleanup.  Should be transparent to most users.    

Version 0.55c
  Corrects continuation slur bug.

Version 0.55b
  Bug correction, but including a substantial rewrite of the lyrics melisma handling.

Version 0.55
  Basically the same as 0.54k.

Version 0.54k (not released)
  DPL: Slurs are no longer translated to s and t, but to ( and {.  This requires
  PMX 2.502.  Labels are inserted into slurs.  

Version 0.54j (not released)
  DPL: "Enable" and "Disable" directives for more flexible handling of optional
  features.  No further development of "Options:" will be made.

Version 0.54h (not released)
  Certain parts of the unwieldy "globals" unit moved to a new "utility" unit.
  Affects programming, not functionality.

Version 0.54g (released only to beta testers)
  DPL: Corrected bug in multfile.pas (end-of-input not properly recognized).

Version 0.54f (released only to beta testers)
  DPL: Cleaning up of files.pas to take full advantage of the new
    multifile.pas unit.  Corrected some obscure bugs.

Version 0.54e (not released)

2004-03-07
  DPL: Added the "Include: filename" directive.  This may appear anywhere,
    and diverts the input stream to the new filename.  This may in turn
    include other files, etc.  A file may be included more than once, but
    do not try recursive includes!  When the end of an included file is
    reached, the stream reverts to the previous file.  End-of-file is
    treated seamlessly and does not act as a paragraph separator.

Version 0.54d (not released)

2004-02-15
  DPL: {...} gives st slurs, }{ works, -t option to retain old behaviour,
    some cleaning up of unused pieces of code.  
    Affects files.pas, globals.pas, mtxline.pas, preamble.pas, prepmx.pas,
      status.pas

2003-06-03
  Christian Mondrup:
  Correct bug in procedure respace: test on 'nspace[ninstr]' rather than on
  nspace[nstaves] in concluding if statement.

Version 0.54a

2002-01-29
  Recognizes PMX words D s t as binding to the left.

Version 0.53a

2001-05-29
    Looks for 'i' anywhere in note (except in shortcut and xtuplet parts)
    and moves it to follow accidental.

2001-05-28
  From Christian Mondrup
    preamble.pas: added trailing backslash to \mtxTenorClef
    mtx.tex: changed \mtxmtxNormalSize to \mtxNormalSize
