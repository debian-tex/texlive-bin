.SH NAME
devnag \- Devanagari for TeX preprocessor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B devnag in[.dn] [out[.tex]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B devnag
is a preprocessor that reads transliterated Devanagari input delimited by
\dn and converts it into a form with which TeX is familiar.
.PP
The preprocessor
handles the details of character placement such as the alignment of
vowel diacritics and consonant ligatures. The rest of the layout,
however, must be managed by the user. 
.PP
For specification of the format please see the documentation accompanying
the package.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
in[.dn] out[.tex]
The default file extension for an input file is .dn and for an output
file .tex. The output filename is optional. If an output filename is
not specified, the preprocessor will name it after the input file.
