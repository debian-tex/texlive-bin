@* Function and Use.
This small program will convert SJIS encoded Japanese characters into a
`preprocessed' form. The need of this program arises from the fact that this
encoding uses the characters `\.{\\}', `\.{\{}', and `\.{\}}' which have
special meanings in \TeX.

Use this program as a filter:

\hskip 2em \.{sjisconv < input\_file > output\_file}


@* The program.
The only function of this program is to replace all occurrences of SJIS
encoded two byte characters \.{XY} with
\.{\char94 \char94 7fX\char94 \char94 7fZZZ\char94 \char94 7f} (\.{X}
and \.{Y} are the first and the second byte of the character; \.{ZZZ}
represents the second byte as a decimal number).

Additionally we define a \TeX\ macro at the very beginning to signal a
preprocessed file.

The following code is very simple. No error detection is done because \TeX\
which will see the output of \.{sjisconv} complains loudly if something is
wrong.

Note that the user-defined character area of SJIS (with the first bytes in
the range 0xF0--0xFC) is not supported because it is not portable.
