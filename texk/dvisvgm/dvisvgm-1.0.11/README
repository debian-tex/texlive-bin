dvisvgm -- A DVI to SVG converter

DESCRIPTION

 dvisvgm is a utility for TeX/LaTeX users. It converts
 DVI files to the XML-based scalable vector graphics format SVG.


DEPENDENCIES

 dvisvgm relies on the following free libraries:
   * FreeType 2 (http://www.freetype.org)
     This library is used to extract glyph outlines
     from PFB files.

   * Ghostscript (http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost)
     The PostScript special handler requires the Ghostscript
     library libgs.so (Linux) or gsdll32.dll (Windows) to be
     installed. If the configure script finds the corresponing 
     Ghostscript development files on the system, it directly 
     links against libgs.so. Otherwise, the library is looked up 
     at runtime and PostScript support is enabled only if libgs.so 
     could be found. 
     Due to incompatible changes of the Ghostscript API, dvisvgm 
     requires Ghostscript 8.31 or later.

   * kpathsea
     This library is part of the Web2C package and is
     usually installed in conjunction with a TeX distribution.
     kpathsea provides functions for searching files in the
     large texmf tree.

   * potracelib (http://potrace.sourceforge.net)
     Peter Selinger's bitmap tracing library is utilized to
     vectorize Metafont's bitmap output.
     The latest version of the library is bundled with the
     source tarball.

   * zlib (http://www.zlib.org)
     Compressed SVG files are produced by using functions
     of this library and the Gzstream wrapper classes
     (http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/compgeom/gzstream)
     which are licensed under LGPL version 2.1 (or optionally any 
     later version) and should be included with this package.

 If you want to build and run the testsuite located in the tests
 subdirectory, you also need the googletest libraries
 (http://code.google.com/p/googletest).


COMPILATION

 Quick installation info:
   * type "./configure"
   * type "make"
   * type "make install" as root (or "sudo make install")

 For generic configuration instructions see the file INSTALL.

 The configure script should recognize all necessary parameters.
 If a library is installed but not detected, specify its location
 as commandline parameter of configure, e.g.
   ./configure --with-freetype=/usr/local/freetype
 (all available options can be displayed with ./configure --help)

 The tracer module calls Metafont in case of lacking TFM or PFB files
 via a system call. Please ensure that Metafont is installed and
 reachable through the search path.
 
 If you don't like compiling the sources yourself, you can
 download pre-compiled executables for Windows and MiKTeX
 from sourceforge.net instead (see below).


USAGE
 Information about the command-line interface and the available options
 can be found in the manual page.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
 This packacke is available from CTAN (dviware/dvisvgm) and can
 be downloaded from the project website at sourceforge.net as well:

    http://dvisvgm.sourceforge.net

 Here you can find the sources, precompiled binaries and further additional
 information about the converter and related topics.

 If you've found a bug, please let me know. You can either send me an
 email or preferably use the bug tracker at Launchpad
 (see https://launchpad.net/dvisvgm).
