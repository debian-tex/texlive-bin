Originally written by Karl Berry, 2022. Public domain.

This directory, Build/source/texk/bibtex-x, contains the sources for
bibtex8 (supporting 8-bit character sets) and bibtexu (supporting
Unicode).

See the 00* and 01* files, and the man pages, for what documentation
there is about the programs. (Not much.)

History: bibtex8 was written first, by Niel Kempson and Alejandro
Aguilar-Sierra, ca.1996. bibtexu was derived from bibtex8 by Yannis
Haralambous and his students, ca.2009. Peter Breitenlohner integrated
bibtexu into TeX Live, and the Japanese TeX Development Community
(notably TANAKA Takuji) has brought it up to date in the years since.

Both are now maintained as part of TeX Live.
