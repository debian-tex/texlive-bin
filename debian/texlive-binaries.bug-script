IMPORTANT INFORMATION: We will only consider bug reports concerning
the packaging of TeX Live as relevant. If you have problems with
combination of packages in a LaTeX document, please consult your
local TeX User Group, the comp.text.tex user group, the author of
the original .sty file, or any other help resource. 

In particular, bugs that are related to up-upstream, i.e., neither
Debian nor TeX Live (upstream), but the original package authors,
will be closed immediately.

   *** The Debian TeX Team is *not* a LaTeX Help Desk ***

If you report an error when running one of the TeX-related binaries 
(latex, pdftex, metafont,...), or if the bug is related to bad or wrong
output, please include a MINIMAL example input file that produces the
error in your report.

Please run your example with
	(pdf)latex -recorder ...
(or any other program that supports -recorder) and send us the generated
file with the extension .fls, it lists all the files loaded during
the run and can easily explain problems induced by outdated files in
your home directory.

Don't forget to also include minimal examples of other files that are 
needed, e.g. bibtex databases. Often it also helps
to include the logfile. Please, never send included pictures!

If your example file isn't short or produces more than one page of
output (except when multiple pages are needed to show the problem),
you can probably minimize it further. Instructions on how to do that
can be found at

http://www.minimalbeispiel.de/mini-en.html (english)
