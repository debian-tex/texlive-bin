Changes from PMX 2.5 to 2.603, 15 April 2011

2.501 (Note: new scor2prt)

Bugfix: initialize index in PMX subroutine putorn to eliminate subscript
error detected in some compilers Bugfix in scor2prt: Ignore special
treatment of special symbols if they appear between double quotes.
Tweak: move end of first part of line­break ties slightly to the right.

2.502 (Note: new pmx.tex)

The height of a figured bass vertical stack can now be adjusted upward by
an integral number of \internote by appending "+" and the number. Recall
that it can already be moved downward 4\internote by prepending "_"
(underscore). The two options can be combined to provide full control
over the vertical position.  Ties can now be represented with braces
"{" before a note and "}" after. Both are equivalent to "t" after the
note. (Thanks to Dirk Laurie).  In pmx.tex all the commands of the form
\font\...=\fontid sy1000 have been changed to \font\...=cmsy10 (Thanks
to Olivier Vogel).

2.503

Enable arpeggio left shift with ?­[x] Allow musicsize of 24 and 29.
Bugfix: Fix bug introduced in 2.415 which caused error in printing
replacement number in xtup.

2.504

Gap between normal grace and main note: X[x] as option to the G command,
where x is the gap size in notehead widths.  Bugfix: og (segno) now
works OK when nv .ne. noinst.

2.505

A new global option AK activates special rules for vertical positioning of
rests in two­voice staves.  By way of background, without the new option,
rests in two­voice staves have default positions based on a simple rule
that is not context­sensitive: those in the lower voice (the one before
"//") are 4\internote below their single­voice default positions,
and those in the upper line are 2\internote above the single­voice
default. The new option invokes a set of context­sensitive rules to
set the default position. The baseline rule is to align the rest in
a horizontal line with the next following note in the same bar. If
there is no following note in the bar, then it is aligned with the next
prior note. If there are simulataneous rests in both voices, the old
rule is applied. When the AK option is in force, it only affects places
where there are two voices in a staff. It may be toggled on and off at
the beginning of any input block, using just AK. When the option is in
effect, any user­defined tweaks on the height of a rest will supersede
the option for that particular rest, i.e., the tweak will be applied
relative to the single­voice default position.

2.506

Fixes a bug in AK. Simultaneous, equal­duration rests will be positioned
according to the default rules.

2.507

Enhancement to global option AK for vertical positioning of rests in
two­voice staves (see version 2.505): The option L ("look left") in a rest
will cause the vertical position of that rest to be based on the preceding
note, rather than the following one as is the default when AK has been
issued Partial bugfix: In unbeamed xtuplets, the length of the bracket
and position of the number are now adjusted to account for any inserted
hardspaces.  Bugfix: unbeamed xtups with two flags are now allowed.

2.508

Allow grace notes in xtuplets.

2.509

Correct small bug in arpeggio left­shifting (it got confused when there
was more than one voice on a staff).

2.510

Bugfix: Correct omission of character variable declarations in new
subroutine getgrace introduced in 2.508.

2.511 (Note: new scor2prt named s2p2511.exe)

Bugfix: Correct error in horizontal spacing introduced in 2.507.
Experiment: Remove prohibition against tempo changes in MIDI macros.
Bugfix in scor2prt: Make it work right when "R" command occurs at end
of input block and "/" is on next line (as produced by M­Tx).

2.512

Enable multiplicity down­up "][" within xtuplet

2.513

Bugfix: If there is more than one rest at start of a beamed xtuplet marked
as a forced beam, beam height and slope tweaks are now properly handled.
Bugfix: If an xtuplet with multiplicity 2 or 3 starts with a rest, the
rest is now printed correctly.  Bugfix: Unbeamed xtuplets (with option
'a' on first note) with multiplicity 2 or 3 are now printed correctly.

2.514

Bugfix: Correct horizontal spacing when after­grace is immediately
followed by normal grace.  Bugfix: Correct transpose register when it
has been changed in a single after­grace.

2.515

Bugfix: Correct error in automatic forced beams. Before the fix, if the
beam did not start an integral number of beam durations from the start
of the bar, incorrect results would occur.  Bugfix: Properly center
fermata over centered whole­bar rest.

2.516 (Note: new pmx.tex)

Allow figures in voice #2.

2.517

Allow figures in two voices, voice 1 and any other one.

2.518

Bug fixes in 2­voice figures.

2.519

Fix bug that prevented \sk from being output, misaligning some voices.

2.520

New feature: special characters 2+, 4+, 5+, 6+, 9+ for figured bass. In
the PMX string for any figure, follow the number by 's'. This uses the
font cmrj from the new package figbas. You must install this font in
your TeX setup for this to work.

2.521

Bugfix: Font definition syntax corrected so no extra space is introduced.

2.602 (Note: new pmx.tex; requires eTeX)

Allow 24 voices, beams, slurs. Require etex.  Include comment about
doubling size of internal buffer to 131072, requiring gfortran for
Windows to compile.  Correct slur indexing in linebreakslurs.  Account for
comment lines in line count for error messages

2.603 (Note: new scor2prt)

In getpmxmod.for, decrease nline by 2 to fix locating errors following
reading in an include file.  Add some error messages in g1etset.for
setup data

2.610

Instrument-wise transposition: Ki[instrument #][+/-][trans
amt.][+/-][new key]. For more than one instrument, may immediately
repeat everything after "K". Must either be at start of score (right
after setup), or if later, must be preceded by normal (full score) key
change command K+0[+/-][new key]. Must be used with relative accidentals
("Ar"). Part(s) to be transposed must be entered in concert key, and
will appear transposed in the score. MIDI behavior not yet tested.
Has not yet been integrated into scor2prt, so for now if you want to
make parts, only use Ki... as score-only (on line after "%%") and/or
instrument only (on same line after %[Instrument #]).

2.613

Set error trap if "D" is entered before any notes.

Enhance "AS" to allow spacing adjustments tailored for either smallsize
or tinysize. As before, "AS" must be followed by nv characters, but now
they may be "0" for normal, "-" or "s" for small, or "t" for tiny. Still
must set sizes of instruments with inline TeX. 

Bugfix: Fixed broken "K-..." in 2.610.

2.614

Bugfix: revise raised dotted rests by separately raising rest and dot. 

2.615 *(Note: new scor2prt)*

Command "AS", described above under 2.163, now also causes staff sizes
to change (in score only, not parts), so inline TeX is no longer needed
to change sizes of selected staves. 

Scor2prt transfers partwise transposition commands Ki... (see 2.610
above) into parts.

2.616

"Feature" added: Hairpin dynamics now may span input blocks.

2.617

Repaired several obscure bugs related to platform and compiler
dependencies; see pmxab.f for details.

2.6.18

For letter and a4 paper respectively, commands "Acl" and "Ac4" set
horizontal and vertical sizes and offsets that center the page with no
further adjustments required in dvips.
