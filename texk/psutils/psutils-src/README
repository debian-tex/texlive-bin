PostScript Utilities

Web site: https://github.com/rrthomas/psutils
Maintainer: Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>

PSUtils is a suite of utilities for manipulating PostScript documents
produced according to the Document Structuring Conventions (some older
software may need to be configured to produce DSC-conformant
PostScript; if PSUtils doesn't work, check your documentation). It is
possible to select and rearrange pages, including arrangement into
signatures for booklet printing, and page merging for n-up printing.

PSUtils should work in any POSIX environment with libpaper (support on
non-POSIX systems may be provided by gnulib).

libpaper: http://packages.qa.debian.org/libp/libpaper.html
Ghostscript: http://www.ghostscript.com/


PROGRAMS

psbook          rearrange pages into signatures
psselect        select pages and page ranges
pstops          perform general page rearrangement and selection
psnup           put multiple pages on to one page
psresize        alter document paper size
epsffit         fit an EPSF file to a given bounding box
extractres      filter to extract resources from PostScript files
includeres      filter to include resources into PostScript files
psjoin          concatenate multiple PostScript files

psselect in modeled on Chris Torek's dviselect, as is psbook, via
Angus Duggan's dvibook; pstops is modeled on Tom Rokicki's dvidvi.


INSTALLATION

To build, you need the following programs installed, as well as a
standard POSIX environment and C compiler:

  automake, autoconf, git, perl

Then run:

./bootstrap && ./configure && make && [sudo] make install

For installation options, see ./configure --help


BUGS

The utilities don't check for PS-Adobe-?.? conformance; they assume documents
conform.

Please send bug reports, patches and suggestions to the bug tracker or
maintainer (see the top of this file).
