Release notes for version 1.14 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.


This release changes raw PostScript processing to avoid the
non-rendering PostScript specials created by hyperref. A command-line
switch to turn off raw PostScript rendering has been added. Finally, a
few bugs has been fixed, such as correct decoding of the -T switch, a
CRLF bug when reading configuration files in Windows, and a few bugs
associated to subprocesses.


Report any bugs you find, see README for instructions.
