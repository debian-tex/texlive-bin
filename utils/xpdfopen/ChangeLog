	* pdfopen.c:  add ability to parse and send function-keys.
		      Add code (commented out) in an attempt to
		      support okular (see code comments).

2010-04-24  Jim Diamond <jim.diamond@acadiau.ca>

	* utils.[ch]: put a function to create window titles there
	* xpdfopen.h: put constants related to the titles of various
	              PDF viewers there
	* pdfclose.c: modify to use utils.c and xpdfopen.h
	* pdfopen.c:  major modifications so it works with AR7, AR8, AR9
	              xpdf and maybe AR5, and so that it might be
		      relatively straightforward to add other PDF viewers.
		      The default viewer is AR9, this can be overridden
		      by an environment variable and a command-line
		      argument.
	* sendx.c:    Reset the error status in open_channel() so that an
		      error return doesn't become permanent.
		      Fixed mask param in XSendEvent().
