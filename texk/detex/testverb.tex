% Sadly, this is not tested as part of make check; if you feel so
% inclined, please add it. For now, just including the file for the record.
% 
% The problem was that the \verb parsing in detex.l did not check for
% going past eof when looking for the matching delimiter. With random
% stuff following the \verb, this would typically cause a crash ("in
% __memmove_avx_unaligned_erms") as buffers filled with junk.
% 
% Testing for eof before the opening delimiter catches another case in
% the code.
% 
% Also, as long as we're here, might as well check that the closing
% delimiter is found on the same line as the opening, since that's what
% LaTeX requires.
