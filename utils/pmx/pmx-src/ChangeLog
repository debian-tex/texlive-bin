    Iv but buggy when used with IT and Ib
2.87

  Check for and allow "\ in centered page headings with P command.
  Check for and allow "\ in text dynamics with D command.
  For lyrics string starting in xtuplet, insert check for inputting musixlyr.
  For staff-crossing beamed xtuplet chords, if 2nd segment of a joined beam
    starts with a blank rest, put '\sk' into the TeX. 
    To enable high-to-both beamed etup staff-crossing chord, for blank
    rest at start of forced beam, shift \sk's from before to after \ib..;
    so \ib is at start and note in upper voice has a beam to connect to.
  Expand range of vertical xtup number shift, now stored in mult(16-22) 
  Check for and allow \" within lyrics strings, for umlauts.
2.73 (160121)
  Dirk's "..." command, to convert "text" into \pmxlyr{text}\ and insert as

  "AT" to allow Col. S.'s tuplet option. Simply input tuplet.tex and redefine
     \xnum, \unbkt, \ovbkt.

2.405: Not published but saved for safety.
  Option Aph to write \special{header=psslurs.pro} top of each page, so
    dviselec will work OK.
2.404
  Allow slur to end on rest, but not start on a rest.  Efaults height 
    of ending is default height of start (before any automatic or user-

  Enable "Rz"; define \setzalaligne in pmx.tex. Special treatment at end
    of input block before movement break, and at start of block after

2.35
  Cautionary accidentals with 'c' anywhere in note symbol.
  NEW pmx.tex with \resetsize to set size to normal or small depending on 
    current \internote.  Used with new coding in dograce() to get right
    new size in case user has \setsize'ed some lines to \smallvalue. For
    \smallvalue-sized staves, redefine \tinynotesize to give 11-pt font. 
    Affects pmx.tex.
  Continuation figure with fractional length. May now mix with other figures.
    If another figure follow Cont-fig, separate with colon.   
2.342

     onto (-1.,5.35)
  Fix ihornb bug in dodyn, seen with dynamics on lower-voice non-beamed xtups
2.32 (Noticed after posting)
  Prohibit "/" as figure.
2.32 (Posted)
  Tidied up accidentals in chords, do spacing.
  Still to do: 
      check for "(" on chord notes in spacing algo
      small accids
      double accids
      autoshift slurs
2.310
  Extra call to precrd ahead of spacing chk, and single-note crd/acc
     shifts seem OK, but not multiple.  crd/acc shifts not recorded 1st time. 
2.309
  Alternate algo for accid shifts in chords.
2.308
  Auto horiz. notehead shifting added to precrd. 
2.307
  Auto shifting of multiple accidentals in chords.
  "Ao" in main chord note to keep accidentals in order. Set nacc(28).
  If there are any manual main or chord note shifts, then
     If any manual shift is preceded by "A" then
        1. Auto-shifting proceeds
        2. "A"-shifts add to autoshifts
        3. non-"A" shifts are ignored!
     Else (>0 man shifts, none has "A")
        No auto-ordering, No autoshifts, 
     End if
  End if

  vshrink stuff all OK? Description is in pmxb.  
2.302
  Toggle vshrink with "Av". vshrink normally kicks in when \interstaff

    use right 2nd and 3rd args for \mbrest when key, meter, or clef changes.
2.296

    make list in setupb by voice of eloff (h-offset) and mtupv (printed #)
  Increase lengths of jobname and infileq by 20 characters

  As above, "F" will (a) increase multiplicity by 1 for marked note and next
    one and (b) add a dot to the first one.

  MIDI velocity (volume) set: Iv[n1]:[n2]:[n3]...
2.293
  Check for single notes spanning bar lines.
  Correct various bugs with staff-jumping beams. (1) for 2nd segment, vxtup 
    must be set in make2bar since beamstrt is not called, fixing problem with
    dot at end. (2) add ivjb2 to flag which voice has 2nd segment and fix 
    problem when >2 staves.
  Add nodur to args of dodyn, so can check if stemless and avoid height tweak
  Correct bug in getdyn setting flag in idynda2(0) for manual horiz. tweak
2.292a

    ...Different ways of storing accidental specs on input and output.
  No longer zap \writezbarno in special situations.
  Fix bug in dyntxt level on rest
  Line spacing equalization.  Add macros \starteq, \endeq, \spread, etc.
    Activate with Ae.  (Maybe later could input alternate values for
    \upamt, \dnamt, \parskip).  Put \starteq on 1st note in voice 1 
    in the page, and \endeq on 1st note of next-to-last line in page.
2.28
  Flip direction of forced beam "[f..."
  Fix beam numbering for staff jumping beams. Uses irest(23,24,29,30)

    order may not be monotonic if two lines on a staff.

  Allow hairpin start-stop on same note by disabling auto-tweaks in dodyn,
    increasing dimension of idynn to 4 to allow 4 symbols on same note.
  Increase voltxtq length from 10 to 20.
  AS[-/0][-/0]...  to inform PMX that "-" voices are small, and rough 
     accounting for ast's is done by defining effective headwidth 
     whead1 in makebar2 to be 0.8*whead.  
2.25
  Fix logic bug with sepsym's when # of instruments changes.
  Slight increases in default offsets for hairpin starts after "p"

  Many automatic position tweaks for letter-group dynamics and hairpins.
2.23
  Continued rhythmic shortcuts: space followed by "." or ","
2.22
  In call to doslur, change tno(...) to tnote(...).  This was only
    used when checking to slurs per stem directions, and should have been
    the note duration all along.
  MIDI-only accidental, bit 17 in nacc, or 27 in icrdat. 
      Use "i" anywhere in note symbol.

    about "o" and 1 as shorthand for 16???? Search for "Kluge"
  Added "vo" (voice) as MIDI instrument 55 
  Allow 3-digit page numbers (search for "toppageno")

    Note also, iflb starts at 0!
