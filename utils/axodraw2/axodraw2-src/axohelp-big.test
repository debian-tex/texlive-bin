# Notes about interpretation of tests:
# The test file was generated in the compilation of axodraw2's manual,
# and this test script therefore verifies much functionality of
# axohelp.  However, if the test fails, it may not actually indicate
# an error.  There are two possibilities for spurious failure:
# a. There is a mismatch of line endings (\n v. \r\n, etc) between the
#    generated test file test-big.ax2 and the reference file
#    test-big.ax2-std.  Correct the problem by adjusting
#    test-big.ax2-std accordingly.
# b. Some of the numbers in the output file are generated by complex
#    floating point computations.  Rounding errors can generate small
#    differences between the generated file and the reference file.
#    This results, for example, from a 32-bit executable compared with
#    a 64-bit executable, or from a compilation with different
#    compilers and the associated libraries (e.g., VisualStudio
#    compared with gcc).
# Interpret the results of the test accordingly.
