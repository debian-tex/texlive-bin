ChangeLog: Changes for DVIPDFMx
===============================

2012-04-20  Norbert Preining  <preining@logic.at>

	* DVIPDFMx-20120420 release

2012-04-20  Alexander Grahn  <A.Grahn@hzdr.de>

	* src/spc_pdfm.c: use kpse to find media

2012-04-20  Norbert Preining  <preining@logic.at>

	* src/dvipdfmx.c: add a new directive "i" for reading subsidiary
	config files
	* data/dvipdfmx.cfg: document the new directive

2012-03-29  Peter Breitenlohner  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* Remove extern decls from *.c files.
	* dpxfile.c: Drop obsolete comment that mkstemp may not be
	declared in stdlib.h.
	* spc_color.c: Drop 'extern' from function definition.
	* error.h: ANSI C prototype for error_cleanup().
	* error.c: Drop extern decl, now in error.h.
	* dvipdfmx.c: Add '#include "error.h"' and drop extern decl.

2012-03-05  Peter Breitenlohner  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* pdfdev.c: Handle UTP-16 surrogates for UCS-4
	supplementary planes.  Based on patch from Tanaka Takuji-san.

2012-01-17  Hironori Kitagawa  <h_kitagawa2001@yahoo.co.jp>

	* dvi.c, pdfdev.c:: Support for (e-)(u)pTeX dtou direction.

2011-11-05  Akira Kakuto  <kakuto@fuk.kindai.ac.jp>

	* dvi.c, spc-pdfm.c, tfm.c and vf.c: remove incompatible lines
	with the non-upTeX case and erase #ifdef upTeX.

2011-10-18  Peter Breitenlohner  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* tt_cmap.c: Fix typo "featre" -> "feature".

	* dvi.c, spc-pdfm.c, tfm.c and vf.c: apply patches by Takuji Tanaka
	in order to support (e)-upTeX. The (e)-upTeX support is enabled by
	defining upTeX. In the case -DupTeX, the dvipdfmx must be compatible
	with the old one, which can be obtained without -DupTeX.

2011-06-15  Peter Breitenlohner  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* dpxcrypt.c: Use headers as in configure test for uint32_t.

	* dpxfile.c (exec_spawn): Do not quote execvp() arguments.

2011-06-03  Peter Breitenlohner  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* dpxfile.c (exec_spawn): Exit if execvp() fails, some clean up.

2011-06-03  Akira Kakuto  <kakuto@fuk.kindai.ac.jp>

	* dpxfile.c: fix a bug in exec_spawn().

2011-05-03  Peter Breitenlohner  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>

	* man/extractbb.1: Update man/extractbb.1.

2011-03-11  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* dpxcrypt.c:
          Applied the patch for 64bit systems; suggested by Akira Kakuto.

2011-03-09  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* dpxfile.c, configure.in, man/extractbb.1:
          Applied the patches for TeX Live 2011 by Peter Breitenlohner.

2011-03-07  Matthias Franz

	* dvi.c, dvi.h, dvipdfmx.c, pdfencrypt.c, pdfencrypt.h, spc_pdfm.c:
          Added special pdf:encrypt to turn on document encryption from
          within the DVI file (suggested by Michael Joyner). Format:
            \special{pdf:encrypt ownerpw (abc) userpw (xyz) length 128 perm 252}
          If a parameter is omitted, the default value / empty password
          is used. The special must appear at the beginning of the file.

2011-03-05  Jin-Hwan Cho
	* dpxfile.c:
          Applied the secutiry patch written by Akira Kakuto
          (suggested by Karl Berry).

2010-10-11  Matthias Franz

	* dvipdfmx.cfg:
          Added quotes around command line parameters %i and %o
          (suggested by Karl Berry).

2010-05-29  Matthias Franz

	* dpxfile.c, dpxfile.h, pdfobj.c, pdfximage.c:
          Further changes to fix the "%hhu" problem on Solaris 9.

2010-05-26  Matthias Franz

	* pdfobj.c:
          Changed type of PDF minor number from char to short in
          check_for_pdf_version in order to fix a compilation problem with
          Solaris 9; reported by Ulrich Seidl.

2010-05-24  Matthias Franz

	* dvipdfmx.cfg:
          Generate PDF 1.5 as default (suggested by Karl Berry).

2010-03-28 Jin-Hwan Cho

	* dvi.c, dvi.h, dvipdfmx.c, spc_pdfm.c:
          Implemented a new special \special{pdf: minorversion num} which
          will override the value given either by the configuration file
          or by the command line option; requested by Karl Berry.

2010-03-21 Jin-Hwan Cho

	* cidtype2.c:
          Assume that the output encoding of CMap files is UTF-16, not UCS2
          as the recent Adobe-Japan1-UCS2 shows; reported by Haruhiko Okumura
          and the patch were prepared by Akira Kakuto.

2010-02-22 Matthias Franz

	* pngimage.c:
          Made PNG code work with libpng14, as suggested by Karl Berry.

2010-02-07 Matthias Franz

	* type1.c:
          Fixed bug caused by fonts without data for private dictionary.
          (The private dictionary was omitted instead of inserting an
          empty dictionary.) This caused problems with Acrobat Reader, for
          example with the dsrom10 font. Bug reported by Vladimir Vlasov.

2010-02-07 Jin-Hwan Cho

	* dvipdfmx.c, pdfdoc.c, pdfobj.h, pdfobj.c, pdfencrypt.h, pdfenctypr.c:
          Now the trailer always contains ID array to work Screen annotations
          under Adobe Reader 9.

2009-12-14 Matthias Franz

	* dvipdfmx.c:
          Turn on quiet mode earlier if "-q" option is given.

2009-11-28 Matthias Franz

	* spc_dvips.c:
          Fixed bug in "ps: plotfile" special, found by Alexander Bostroem.

2009-11-18 Matthias Franz

	* man/extractbb.1, man/Makefile.am, Makefile.am, configure.in:
          Added man page for extractbb in new directory man. This
          addresses Debian bug #512357 and a request by Karl Berry.

2009-10-10  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* dvipdfmx.c, xbb.c:
          Change usage() as suggested by Matthias Franz and Karl Berry.

2009-10-09  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* dvipdfmx.c:
          Implemented the usual options --version and --help
          (suggested by Karl Berry.)

2009-09-19  Matthias Franz

	* epdf.c, pdfdoc.c, pdfdoc.h, xbb.c:
          Bug fix: The number of pages in a PDF document as reported by
          extractbb was always 0. (The code for reporting the number of
          pages of a PDF file was accidentally removed during a previous
          modification.)

2009-09-18  Matthias Franz

	* dpxutil.c, dpxutil.h and all calls to the changed functions:
          Polished code for hash tables. Now the function for freeing
          values is defined with ht_init_table. ht_append_table now
          produces an error if the key is already in use (but this
          could be changed easily). A new insert mode where a value
          does _not_ replace an existing value for the same key has
          been introduced, but there is no short name for it yet.

2009-08-30  Matthias Franz

	* dvipdfmx.cfg:
          Turned on optimization of PDF destinations by default.

2009-08-27  Matthias Franz

	* truetype.c, type1.c, type1c.c:
          Changed precision in font widths arrays from 1.0 to 0.1.
          (Applies only to Type 1, Type 1C and TrueType, not PK fonts.)

2009-08-23  Matthias Franz

	* epdf.c, pdfdoc.c, pdfdoc.h, pdfximage.c, pdfximage.h, xbb.c:
          Removed the feature of negative page numbers for PDF inclusion.
          It was never used and made the code more complicated.

	* dvipdfmx.c, pdfximage.c:
          Changed the code for PS and PDF page inclusion:
          The function mkstemp on NetBSD may return the same name twice
          if the file has been deleted after the first call. (Reported
          by Jukka Salmi.) This interfered with our file name caching.
          Now we don't delete the temporary file after PS->PDF conversion,
          but cache the temporary file name instead. An advantage is that
          we don't have to convert the same file multiple times if several
          pages are imported.

2009-08-17  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* tt_post.c:
          Fixed the crashing bug with Mona font found by Alexis Ballier.

2009-07-08  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* dvipdfmx.c:
          Add -E option that enables DVIPDFM emulation mode in DVIPDFMx.

2009-07-07  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* pdfximage.c, pdfximage.h, spc_pdfm.c:
          Add pdf_ximage_set_attr() and pdf_ximage_get_subtype()
          to resolve the conflict with bmpsize package in dvipdfm
          emulation mode; reported by Heiko Oberdiek.

2009-05-22  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* generic/pgf-doc-diff.version2cvs, generic/pgf-generic-diff.version2cvs:
          Removed the patches for the CVS version of pgf,
          because they are applied to the main stream.

2009-05-10  Matthias Franz

	* epdf.c:
          Don't try to convert included PDF files whose version number
          is higher than output file version. (If run as dvipdfm,
          conversion still occurs.)

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, dvipdfmx.c, dvipdfmx.h, jpegimage.c, pngimage.c, xbb.c, xbb.h:
          Added dvipdfm compatibility mode. This mode is triggered
          if dvipdfmx is called as "dvipdfm", and likewise extractbb
          as "ebb". (The latter mode was already present.)

	* dpxconf.c:
          Made predefined paper sizes match values given by libpaper.

2009-05-06  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* dvipdfmx.c, pdflimits.h, pdfobj.c:
          Improved PDF version handling.

	* cmap_read.c:
          Fixed a silly bug; reported by Fumihito YOSHIDA.

2009-05-06  Matthias Franz

	* cid.c, dvipdfmx.c, pdflimits.h, pdfobj.c:
          Fixed minor issues with PDF version handling, following
          a question by Akira Kakuto. The minimal and maximal
          PDF versions allowed are now defined in pdflimits.h.

2009-05-03  Matthias Franz

	* dvipdfmx.c, epdf.c, epdf.h, pdfdoc.c, pdfdoc.h, pdfobj.c, pdfobj.h, pdfximage.c, pdfximage.h, xbb.c:
          Improved PDF version handling. A "Version" entry in the
          document catalog is now honored. Moreover, dvipdfmx accepts
          to write PDF 1.7, and extractbb doesn't complain about PDF
          versions any more. Encryption keys too long for PDF 1.3 now
          lead to an error instead of a silent change of PDF version.

2009-05-02  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* tt_table.c:
          Fixed a bug of reading numOfExSideBearings; reported by
          Tomas Janousek.

2009-04-30  Matthias Franz

	* dvipdfmx.cfg:
          Use ps2pdf for PS-to-PDF conversion on all platforms.

2009-04-29  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* spc_color.c, spc_pdfm.c, spc_util.c, spc_util.h:
          Allow changing strokecolor or fillcolor only; for example,
          "pdf:scolor Red []" changes fillcolor only and
          "pdf:scolor [] Red" changes strokecolor only, but
          "pdf:scolor Red" changes both fillcolor and strokecolor.

	* pdfparse.c:
          Parse stream objects in a strict way as DVIPDFM because
          DVIPDFMx already has another specials for stream objects.

2009-04-26  Matthias Franz

	* pdfobj.c:
          Don't print unnecessary newlines in PDF dictionaries.

	* pdfobj.c, pdfobj.h, xbb.c:
          Added "%%HiResBoundingBox" and "%%PDFVersion" lines to
          extractbb output.

	* dpxutil.c, dpxutil.h, dvipdfmx.c, pdfdoc.c,pdfdoc.h, pdfnames.c, pdfnames.h, pdfobj.c, pdfobj.h, spc_pdfm.c, specials.c, dvipdfmx.cfg:
          Rename PDF destinations to shorter names (in order to save
          space). Together with the removal of unused PDF destinations
          implemented previously, this is more or less equivalent to
          Heiko Oberdiek's LaTeX package "hypdestopt".

2009-04-20  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* pdfdoc.c:
          Bug fix: \special{pdf:bann} ... \special{pdf:eann} (e.g., \hyperlink)
	  cause a problem when it was surrounded by the pair
	  \special{pdf:bcontent} ... \special{\special{pdf:econtent}.

2009-04-19  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* generic/pgf-doc-diff.texlive2008, generic/pgf-generic-diff.texlive2008:
          Patches and a new dvipdfmx driver for PGF, Version 2.00
	  included in texlive 2008.

	* generic/pgfsys-dvipdfmx.def.version2, generic/pgfsys-dvipdfmx-patch.tex.version2:
          Removed contributed files because of new patch files
	  pgf-doc-diff.texlive2008 and pgf-generic-diff.texlive2008.

2009-04-18  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* generic/pgf-doc-diff.version2cvs, generic/pgf-generic-diff.version2cvs:
          Patches and a new dvipdfmx driver for PGF, Version 2.00-cvs 20090418.

	* contrib/context/spec-dpx.tex, contrib/latex/animate.sty.sample, color.sty.sample, dvipdfmx.def.sample, graphics.sty.sample, movie15.sty.sample, sample-imagemask.tex:
          Removed contributed files already applied to texlive 2008.

2009-04-08  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* t1_load.c:
          Ignores the second /Subrs dicts and /CharStrings not followed
          by dict; Adobe's OPO_____.PFB and OPBO____.PFB had those problems.

2009-04-07  Matthias Franz

	* xbb.c:
          Removed binary mode option "-b". In ebb, just ignore it.

2009-03-30  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* pdfdoc.c:
          Fixed the bug: bbox->llx is not extracted for PDF images.

2009-03-29  Matthias Franz

	* xbb.c:
          Changed output-to-stdout option to "-O".

2009-03-24  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* cff.c, dpxutil.c, pdfencoding.c, pdfencrypt.c, mem.c:
          Revive system.h to work with TeXLive.

2009-03-23  Matthias Franz

	* dvipdfmx.c, jpegimage.c, jpegimage.h, pngimage.c, pngimage.h, xbb.c:
          Several changes related to xbb/extractbb:
	  Combined code with jpegimage.c and pngimage.c, added number
	  of pages to xbb output for PDF files, introduced quiet mode
	  (option "-q") and output to stdout (option "-s"), improved test
	  of filename check in dvipdfmx.c (now uses >libgen.h>), new
	  version numbering for xbb (same as dvipdfmx version)

2009-03-15  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* data/Makefile.am, data/Makefile.in, data/EUC-UCS2:
          Revive the cmap EUC-UCS2; suggested by Nobuyuki Tsuchimura.

2009-03-16  Matthias Franz

	* pdfdev.c, pdfdraw.c, spc_html.c, spc_pdfm.c, spc_tpic.c:
          Added comments to show the PDF operators inserted by each
          call of pdf_doc_add_page_content. This makes it easier to
          find out which part of the source is responsible for a PDF
          operator in the output. Example:

          pdf_doc_add_page_content(work_buffer, len);  /* op: q cm *

2009-03-12  Matthias Franz

	* dvipdfmx.c:
          Don't print messages in quiet mode.

	* dpxfile.c, dpxfile.h, pdfximage.c, data/dvipdfmx.cfg:
          Added conversion specifier "%v" (PDF version) to PS-to-PDF
          conversion template. Also changed default template for
          GhostScript to use the script ps2pdf instead of calling gs
          directly. (This works for all platforms.)

	* pdfobj.c:
          Fixed a bug concerning empty PDF strings: Empty PDF strings
          were reduced to NULL, which could lead to errors when calling
          string functions.

2009-01-15  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* specials.c:
          Apply Jonathan Kew's fix reported on August 7, 2008.
	  (Sorry that it was too late!)

2008-12-11  Matthias Franz

	* xbb.c:
          Fixed an off-by-one and an off-by-two error in the generation
          of output file names for extractbb.
          (Debian bug #506329, reported by G\'abor Braun.)

	* mpost.c, pdfcolor.c, pdfcolor.h, pdfdev.c, pdfdev.h, pdfdoc.c, pdfdraw.c, pdfdraw.h, spc_color.c, spc_pdfm.c:
          Polished the code for color support. PDF color operators will
          not be generated any more if old and new color coincide.

2008-11-30  Matthias Franz

	* spc_tpic.c:
          Polished code.

	* pdfdev.c, spc_html.c:
          Concatenated transformation matrices for images.

	* data/dvipdfmx.cfg, dvipdfmx.c, pdfdoc.c:
          Fixed two problems with removal of PDF destinations: Non-link
          annotations produced a warning, and broken links were not
          detected if no valid destination existed.
          Removing unused destinations is now default behaviour and can
          be prevented by using the flag "-C 0x10". Since the feature
          is still new, this flag is set in dvipdfmx.cfg.

	* spc_color.c, spc_color.h, spc_dvips.c, spc_dvips.h, spc_misc.c, spc_misc.h, spc_pdfm.c, spc_pdfm.h, specials.c:
          Removed unnecessary (no-op) handlers for specials.

	* cid.c, cid.h, dpxconf.c, dpxconf.h, dvi.c, dvi.h, fontmap.c, fontmap.h, numbers.c, numbers.h, pdfcolor.c, pdfcolor.h, pdfdev.c, pdfdev.h, pdfdoc.c, pdfdoc.h, pdfdraw.c, pdfdraw.h, pdffont.c, pdffont.h, pdfobj.c, pdfobj.h, pdfresource.c, pdfresource.h, pst_obj.c, pst_obj.h, tfm.c, tfm.h, tt_table.c, tt_table.h, type0.c, type0.h:
          Commented out unused functions.

2008-11-08  Matthias Franz

	* pdfcolor.c, pdfcolor.h, spc_tpic.c:
          Made tpic specials respect color settings. Before, they
          always used black for drawing commands.
          (Debian bug #485567, reported by Daniel Skorka.)

2008-11-03  Matthias Franz

	* dpxutil.c, dvipdfmx.c, mem.c, pdfdoc.c, pdfdoc.h, pdfnames.c, pdfnames.h:
          Remove unused PDF destinations.  (Packages like hyperref
          create destinations regardless of whether they are used
          or not.)  This option is currently turned off by default;
          it can be enabled with "-C 0x10".

	* dvipdfmx.c:
          Improved parsing of "-v" command line option; contributed
          by Akira Kakuto. Note that there are still problems if an
          argument to an option (or the name of the DVI file) starts
          with a minus sign

	* pkfont.c:
          Corrected bounding box computation for PK fonts. Before,
          it was always [0, 0, 0, 0].  Also removed a redundant call
          to pdf_encoding_add_usedchars.

2008-10-13  Matthias Franz

	* cff.c, cff.h, cff_dict.c, cidtype0.c, pdfdev.c, t1_load.c, type1.c, type1c.c:
          Various speed improvements:
          cff.c: cff_add_string now has an option to avoid checking for
          duplicate strings.
          pdfdev.c: p_dtoa does not call library functions any more.
          t1_load.c: t1_decrypt is not called for each byte seperately
          any more. (Well, this does not make a big difference.)

2008-09-29  Matthias Franz

	* epdf.c, pdfdoc.c, pdfdoc.h, pdfobj.c, pdfobj.h, xbb.c:
          Made PDF parsing more robust. In particular, we can now
          detect (illegal) loops in a PDF document hierarchy.
          Also, much of the PDF parsing code in epdf.c and xbb.c has
          been combined to the function pdf_doc_get_page in pdfdoc.c.
          Loops in PDF page trees are detected as well.
          Moreover, the various bounding boxes of a page are now
          handled correctly: MediaBox and CropBox are inherited,
          but not the others.

2008-08-31  Matthias Franz

	* type1.c:
          Fixed a bug when processing "seac" operators in Type 1
          fonts.  If the base or accent char were not used otherwise,
          an "Invalid SID" error could occur.

2008-08-05  Matthias Franz

          DVIPDFMx supports PGF version 2.00.
          New specials "pdf:bcontent", "pdf:econtent", and "pdf:code".
          Moreover, "pdf:exobj << additional_dict >>" merges additional
          dictionaries into the XObject dictionary, not resources.

	* pgfsys-dvipdfmx.def.version2, pgfsys-dvipdfmx-patch.tex.version2:
          A sample DVIPDFMx driver for PGF version 2.00. Note that
          pgfsys-dvipdfmx-patch.tex must be loaded after loading the 
          basiclayers of PGF. Otherwise image mask and transparency
          group do not work.

2008-06-01  Jin-Hwan Cho

	  Fix the problem with MusiXTeX's Type1 fonts. Some characters
	  of these fonts have different widths from the corresponding
	  TFM files; reported by Yasuhiro Okazaki and Jean-Pierre Coulon.
	  DVIPDFMx now reads character width from TFM if found.
	  Otherwise, the information comes from the font file.
	  However, Type0 fonts (not simple fonts) do not refer to TFM.

2008-05-18  Matthias Franz

	* epdf.c, pdfobj.c, pdfobj.h, xbb.c:
	  Added PDF 1.5 parsing. Note that many PDF 1.5 files have
	  compressed xref streams with DecodeParms entry. Since we
	  don't support this, we cannot read these files.

	* epdf.c:
	  Allow page import from tagged PDF files. Tags are ignored.

	* dvipdfmx.c, xbb.c, xbb.h, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in, contrib/latex/dvipdfmx.def.sample:
	  DVIPDFMx now extracts bounding box information.
	  The binary dvipdfmx can be linked as extractbb, ebb, xbb, and
	  it works as same as the linked name. (extractbb == xbb)
	  This idea was suggested by Karl Berry.

2008-05-17  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4:
	  Remove acinclude.m4. Give a new tag DVIPDFMX-20080517.

	  especially for Chinese truetype fonts, e.g., Simsun;
	  this feature was suggested by Yue Wang.

	* dvipdfmx.def:
	  Support automatic generation of .xbb if -shell-escape is given.
	  Don't forget to replace $TEXMF/tex/latex/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.def
	  to contrib/latex/dvipdfmx.def.sample.

	  Changed code for PDF import so that objects are not duplicated
	  if they are imported through several pages of the same file.
	  Some PDF parsing functions now take an additional argument
	  of type pdf_file. If this is NULL, them indirect references
	  are not accepted.

2008-03-01  Matthias Franz

	* dvipdfmx.def:
	  Write bounding box information only if necessary.

	* dvipdfmx.def, spc_util.c:
	  New 'clip' parameter for 'pdf:epdf' and 'pdf:image'
	  specials. 'clip 1' enables clipping (default),
	  'clip 0' disables it.

2008-02-13  Matthias Franz

	* dvipdfmx.def, epdf.c, pdfdoc.c, pdfximage.c, pdfximage.h, spc_dvips.c, spc_html.c, spc_misc.c, spc_pdfm.c, spc_util.c, spc_util.h:
	  Added new 'page' parameter to PDF and PS inclusion. This
	  can be used with the graphicx package and the (experimental)
	  graphics driver dvipdfmx.def (see contrib/latex). Example:

	  \includegraphics[page=4]{a.pdf}

	  Page numbers can also be negative; the last page is -1.

	  Remarks:
	  1) Currently PDF objects may be duplicated in the output
	     if several pages are included from the same file.
	     -- done (2008-05-13)
	  2) The graphicx package currently uses the same bounding
	     box information (that of the first page) for all pages.

2008-02-13  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, configure.in, configure:

	  meet Adobe Reader's behaviour for revision 3 (PDF 1.4)
	  encryption.

2008-02-08  Matthias Franz

	* epdf.c, pdfobj.c:
	  Improved PDF document parsing: pages without contents,
	  undefined indirect references and media boxes with
	  indirect references are now allowed. (Undefined
	  indirect references are needed for documents with
	  several cross-reference tables if the trailer contains
	  a reference to an object outside the part of the
	  xref table seen so far.)

2008-01-11  Matthias Franz

	* dvipdfmx.c:
	  Fixed a bug in processing DVI comments.

	* cmap_read.c, pst.c, pst_obj.c , t1_load.c:

	  Fixed a bug in pack_real() using work_buffer twice;
	  found by Takanori Uchiyama and reported by Akira Kakuto.

2007-06-30  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* cidtype0.c, cff_dict.h:
	  Fixed a bug checking cid >= CIDCount, which causes a problem
	  with some CJK otf fonts without having the CIDCount value.

2007-06-28  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* cff_dict.c:
	  Modified pack_real() to support musix20.pfb in Mac OS X 10.4 Quartz.
	  It seems that Mac OS X 10.4 Quartz has a bug on reading real numbers
	  in CFF font format. Since Mac OS X 10.4.10 the problem was solved.

2007-05-18  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* jpegimage.c, pngimage.c, pdfximage.c, pdfximage.h, dvipdfmx.c, xbb.c:
	  Updated "xbb" to generate ".xbb" not ".bb". There is a big
	  difference between "xbb" and "ebb" in handling bitmap images.
	  In the case of bitmap images not having density information,
	  there is no way to know the density (or DPI) of the image.
	  "ebb" always assume that the image has 100 DPI so that
	  100 pixels = 1 in = 72 bp. However, in this case, screen
	  capture image does not look clear. Thus, "xbb" follows pdfTeX,
	  which uses density information if exists, otherwise 72 DPI,
	  i.e., 72 pixels = 1 in = 72 bp, is used. With the modified
	  "dvipdfmx.def" driver for the LaTeX graphics package, you can
	  get the same result as pdfTeX.

2007-05-04  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* xbb.c:
	  New program "xbb" extending "ebb".

2007-05-03  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* pdfximage.c, pdfximage.h, dvipdfmx.c:
	  Support bbox for "pdf:image" special (experimental).
	  The program "ebb" extracting the bounding box of image files
	  always multiply 72/100 for bitmap images (png and jpg).
	  It causes some trouble with LaTeX graphicx package which read
	  the bounding box from ".bb" file usually generated by "ebb".
	  New experimantal option "-C 0x0020" is introduced. With this
	  option, dvipdfmx no longer multiply 72/100 for bitmap images
	  so that users can get the same result as pdftex.

2007-04-25  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* spc_pdfm.c:
	  Extended pdf:outline special to support open/close bookmark.
	  The previous version 20070409 had problem because toclevel
	  of part is -1 in some class files.

2007-04-24  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* spc_util.c:
	  Predefined colors, Black, White, and Gray caused some problem
	  in Adobe Reader 7 and 8; but not in other PDF viewers, e.g.,
	  Previewer.app. It was solved by changing cmyk value to gray value.

2007-04-17  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* dvipdfmx.c, pdfobj.c:
	  The default of the PDF minor version was changed from 3 to 4.

	* type1.c:
	  A bug was reported from Werner Lemberg (run nfssfont.tex for
	  the font ptmr8y). It happened when any character is used more
	  than one in one encoding file (e.g., texnansi.enc). To fix it,
	  Encoding resource was revived (but Hirata noted that there was
	  some problem with Ghostscript, not confirmed yet) and Widths
	  resource was changed to look up correct glyphs according to the
	  given encoding.

	* vf.c:
	  Suppress an annoying warning message if no verbose option is given.

2007-04-13  Jin-Hwan Cho

	  Support object stream for PDF v1.5 or higher; contributed by
	  Matthias Franz. Previewer.app in Mac OS X did not work with
	  encryption under v1.5, but no problem with Adobe Reader 8

	* pdfobj.c:
	  Support xref stream for PDF v1.5 or higher; contributed by Matthias Franz

2005-08-11  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* pdfdoc.c, pdfdraw.c, pdfdraw.h, spc_pdfm.c:
	  Optimization of changing transform matrices.
	  The "pdf:literal" special works almost same as pdfTeX's
	  "\pdfliteral" primitive. But "pdf:literal direct" is slightly
	  different from pdfTeX's "\pdfliteral direct". It does not
	  affected by "pdf:literal".

2005-08-08  Jin-Hwan Cho

	* spc_pdfm.c:
	  Test implementation of \special{pdf:literal ...}.

	* spc_misc.c:
	  Ignores \special{pos: ...} too.

	* spec-dpx.tex:
	  Modified to fit the changes introduced in 2005-08-08.

2005-08-02  Jin-Hwan Cho

	  ConTeXt module still has a bug, e.g., \handleMPfshow.

2005-08-01  Shunsaku Hirata

	* specials.c, spc_html.c, spc_pdfm.c:
	  Various minor changes to specials.
	  Rewriting HTML special support.

2005-07-31  Shunsaku Hirata

	* specials.c:
	  Fixed a bug introduced by changes in 2005-07-30.
	  (@page1 not handled correctly)

2005-07-30  Shunsaku Hirata

	* colors.h: removed
	  Color definitions placed into spc_util.c.

	  Simply use sprintf for printing numbers.................
	  Fixed an ancient bug causing very frequent (unnecessary)
	  font selection.

2005-07-21  Shunsaku Hirata

	* pdfencoding.c: Fixed bugs.

	* truetype.c: Update and various changes.
	  Apply ligature GSUB for glyph name "a_b" and glyph names
	  with AGL mapping to multiple Unicode character sequence.
	  Suffixes "liga", "dlig", "frac" ... are always recognized
	  as feature tag for glyph composition. But for "a_b.vert",
	  dvipdfmx first compose glyph "a_b" (by some way) and then
	  apply "vert" substitution to composed glyph. It may often
	  behaves unexpectedly. Suffixes like "aalt1" is treated as
	  alternate substitution; e.g., "a.salt1" is interpreted as
	  first stylistic alternate of default glyph for "a". Those
	  features are just for completeness. (esp. alternate GSUB)
	  Reorganized various process of finding glyphs, but still
	  complicated. TTC is supported (but index is always 0).

2005-07-20  Shunsaku Hirata

	* pdffont.c:
	  Minor changes.

	* pkfont.c:
	  Mostly rewritten. Allow .enc file to be specified
	  in fontmap. But it is not for reencoding but to get
	  glyph names for ToUnicode creation.

	* dpxfile.c:
	  Check file type.

	* pdfcolor.c, vf.c: Don't use strcasecmp, strncmp.

2005-07-18  Shunsaku Hirata

	* pdfximage.c:
	  Set image format conversion filter to NULL if empty
	  string "" is given. Put various system dependent things
	  into dpxfile.c.

	* dpxfile.c:
	  Creation of temporary files, call other program
	  via system() to apply filter to file.

	* dpxconf.c, dpxconf.h: new files
	  Currently paper format related codes.

	* dvipdfmx.c: cleanup
	  Papersize handling --> dpxconf.c
	  Removed undocumented extension for page label.

	* dvipdfmx.c:
	  's' option for MPS-to-PDF conversion mode.  Treat page
	  numbers as suffix. For "dvipdfmx -M -s 1-3 foo",
	  dvipdfmx first tries to open "foo". If "foo" exists,
	  it then start conversion of "foo" (ignore 's'), if not, 
	  "foo.1", "foo.2", and "foo.3" is searched and multi-page
	  PDF file is generated.

2005-07-17  Shunsaku Hirata

	  mangle_name() removed.

	* pdfparse.c, pdfparse.h, dpxutil.c, dpxutil.h, ...:
	  Several parsing routine moved to dpxutil.c.
	  parse_c_ident() is not really for "C" ident.
	  parse_c_string() is not really for "C" string.
	  And there are too many unclear parse_xxx routines
	  unrelated to PDF in "pdfparse". 
	  There are many uncertainty in parsing \special too.

	* spc_xxx:
	  skip_white() wrongly used in many places.
	  skip_white() skips from '%' to newline...

	* pdf:tounicode, pdf:mapfile, and pdf:mapline
	  using very different syntax than other pdf:
	  prefix specials.

	* dvi.c, pdffont.c:
	  Minor changes in debug and error message.

	* psimage.c, psimage.h, t1crypt.c, t1crypt.h: Removed.

	* t1_load.c: Merge t1crypt

	* pdfximage.c, pdfximage.h: Merge psimage
	  psimage.c is not really for PostScript support.
	  It just call external program to do conversion form
	  PS to PDF. There are no reason to restrict this to
	  from-PS conversion.

	* fontmap.c:
	  Do not use pdfparse.c. Added 'u' option to specify
	  "ToUnicode". This is for testing. Don't use this.

	  Read ToUnicode CMap specified in fontmap.

	* spc_util.c: HSB color...
	  Converted to RGB.

	* dvi.c, mpost.c, pdfdev.c:
	  Modification needed by changes in fontmap handling.

	* spc_pdfm.c:
	  Minor changes in fontmap specials. Fixed leak in
	  "append" fontmap.

	  Delete all conflicting explicit fontmap entries for
	  subfonts in pdf_insert_fontmap_record() when adding
	  fontmap entry with @SFD@ extension.

	* subfont.c, subfont.h:
	  Scan SFD file for valid subfont IDs. (Required by
	  changes made to fontmap.c mentioned above.)
	  Removed unnecessary file static variables.
	  Simplified file reading and parsing.

	* dvi.c: set_verbose() for subfont.c

	* fontmap.c:

	  Primitive graphics drawing functions and graphics state
	  management: pdf_dev_moveto, pdf_dev_gsave, pdf_dev_lineto,
	  pdf_dev_flushpath, and so on (migrated from mpost.c).
	  PostScript, tpic, and all other graphics specials should not
	  directly access page content stream but must use those

2004-05-03  Shunsaku Hirata

	* jpegimage.c: Uninitialized variable.

2004-04-09  Shunsaku Hirata

	* README, index.html: update

	* contrib/patches/glyphlist-cm-add.txt: new file
	  Additional glyphlist for Computer Modern font.

	* NEWS: new file
	  Empty.

2004-04-03  Shunsaku Hirata

	* README: update

2004-03-25  Shunsaku Hirata

	* jpegimage.c: ICC profile
	  Added APP2 ICC_PROFILE support.
	  ICC profile is not deleted from JPEG stream.

	* Embedded ICC profile support for JPEG and PNG enabled.
	  ICC profiles are not cached. Alternate color space?

2004-03-24  Shunsaku Hirata

	* Thumbnail support removed.

	* index.html:
	  Quick check against WCAG 1.0. Lowercasified all HTML tags for
	  migration to XHTML.

	* pdfdoc.c:
	  Dvipdfm/dvipdfmx copyright notice remved from PDF Docinfo's
	  /Producer string, simplified to "dvipdfmx (VERSION)".

	* configure.in, configure:
	  Minor change.

2004-03-22  Shunsaku Hirata

	* pngimage.c: Minor changes.

	  Remaining things for complete PNG 1.1 support is:
	  Complete iCCP support. Support tEXt and other metadata chunks
	  using XML Metadata stream. pHYS (and oFFs) support (in ebb).
	  Preserve filter (PNG predictor) if possible, but some softwares
	  using filters very inefficiently. 16-bit RGB/Gray (PDF-1.5).

	  JPEG (JFIF) can also store ICC profile with APP2. Implementing
	  very basic ICC profile support might be useful.

2004-03-21  Shunsaku Hirata

	* README: updated

	* data/config/cid-x.map:
	  "slant" option -s supported in vertical mode.

	* pngimage.c: Fixed a serious bug, more chunks supported.

	  Gamma obtained by png_get_gAMA() is inverse of screen gamma
	  that the image is prepared. Gamma is sometimes inverted...

	  Approximated CalRGB color space used along with /Intent if
	  sRGB chunk is found (not sure how to treat it).

	  Experimental iCCP support --enable-iccp.
	  Doesn't validate ICC profile embedded in PNG.
	  Range? Rendering Intent?

	* pdfdev.c:
	  A line width of zero means thinnest line drawable in target
	  device. dev_rule() was wrongly changed to increase line width
	  if the width is too thin.

2004-03-20  Shunsaku Hirata

	* unicode.c, agl.c, type0.c: ToUnicode CMap support

	  Always create ToUnicode CMap for simple fonts regardless of
	  the existence of glyph list file. If 10% of glyph names can
	  not be converted to Unicode, ToUnicode CMap is not embedded.
	  The reason for the (non-zero) limit 10% is; ToUnicode CMap
	  is shared among fonts using same .enc file. In this case,
	  Unicode mapping is created for all glyphs in the .enc file
	  where non-standard glyph names like "visiblespace" is often
	  expected. But those glyphs are usually not used in the TeX's
	  output and hence it should be simply ignored if mapping is
	  not available.
	  Sharing ToUnicode CMap is not so efficient as expected for
	  simple fonts, "subsetted" ToUnicode CMap might be better. 

	  type0.c search ToUnicode CMap named as REGISTRY-ORDERING-UCS2
	  or FONTNAME-UCS2, the latter case is for CIDFontType 2 font
	  using font's internal glyph ordering. It does not care about
	  the content of CMap at all, especially usecmap is not checked.
	  Don't use it.

	* README, data/config/cid-x.map:

	  Description about -m option removed from README.
	  This option is no longer necessary for usual cases, and use
	  of it is not recommended as the original dvipdfm fails to read
	  fontmap file with this option.

	* cmap.c:

	  Increment n-1 th byte if n-th byte overflow in bfrange like:

	   <00> <01> <00 FF>

	  The dstCode string is treated like an integer, but the number
	  of bytes required for that character code is not increased.
	  Acrobat's "ToUnicode" CMap contains such bfrange entries and
	  causing a serious problem in Korean TrueType fonts.

2004-03-18  Shunsaku Hirata

	* pdfspecial.c:
	  pdf:literal direct should not translate origin.

2004-03-17  Shunsaku Hirata

	* type1.c, type1c.c, cmap.c, ...: Memory leak.

2004-03-16  Shunsaku Hirata

	* mpost.c, psspecialc.: Fixed bugs.

2004-03-14  Shunsaku Hirata

	* dvipdfmx.c:
	  Scan first page's paper size special first.

	* pdfparse.c: \x in PDF string - broken

	  This (undocumented) extension to the PDF string object disturbs
	  and interrupts PDF object parsing and subsequent text re-encoding
	  specified by tounicode special (another extension). And it makes
	  impossible to separate parsing and re-encoding process ("x" after
	  backslash representing Unicode hex value...).
	  
	  Support for this extension was removed since it is desirable to
	  move (or isolate) tounicode special to the appropriate place, not
	  pdfparse but pdfspecial, if possible.

	  Note that this kind of extension might be incompatible with all
	  other PDF applications, "\x" should be treated as a single "x" in
	  literal strings (like PostScript).

	* pdfspecial.c: Special image/uxobj is partially broken.

	  Special uxobj doesn't work for external images after the change
	  made on 2003-08-12. It only works for the grabbed page contents
	  created by special bxobj/exobj.

	  Access to XObject reference (but can't be placed in the document)
	  is now available again. Supporting uxobj is usually not necessary
	  for external images because they are always reused as a document
	  resource but allowing access to the (form) XObject's indirect
	  reference by name like @foo is usefull for using them as an entry
	  of appearance dictionary in annotations.

	* pdfspecial.c, pdfdev.c:

	  Special bann/eann does not take account of current transformation
	  matrix correctly. It result in incorrect /Rect for all annotations
	  created by special bann/eann if transformation is applied.

	  Not fixed yet.

	* pdfparse.c: "ToUnicode" special

	  Illegal PDF string is expected within pdf: specials.  Many users
	  try to use raw Shift-JIS text without properly escaping backslash
	  appears in the 2nd byte of double-byte character. The same problem
	  occurs in many other encodings.

	  As a workaround for this problem, backslashes are not treated as
	  "escape" in some situation when the current "ToUnicode" CMap name
	  contains a substring RKSJ, B5, GBK, or KSC.

	* cmap.c, ...:


2004-03-12  Shunsaku Hirata

	* mpost.c:
	  Skip until %%EndProlog.

	* pdfspecial.c, pdfdev.c, pdfdoc.c:
	  pdf_doc_set_mediasize()/pdf_doc_get_mediasize().

	* tfm.c
	  tfm.c was highly wasteful and inflexible.
	  Preparing for 31-bits character code support.

2004-03-11  Shunsaku Hirata

	* dvipdfmx.c, dvi.[ch], pdfdev.[ch], pdfdoc.[ch],...: 
	  An effort to eliminate complicated initilization chain...

	* pdfximage.c, pdfximage.h: New file.
	  An effort to make image support more flexible.
	  Included images and grabbed page contents (forms) should be managed by
	  pdf_ximage as document resource (like font).

	* pdfspecial.c, psspecial.c:
	  Image support moved to pdfximage. (might be broken)

	* mpost.[ch], epdf.[ch], pngimage.[ch], jpegimage.[ch], psimage.[ch]:
	  Image support moved to pdfximage.

	* dvipdfmx.c, mpost.[ch]:
	  Experimental "mpspdfmx" mode -M.

	* pdfspecial.c, pdfdev.c, pdfdoc.c:
	  Hard to explain... There are many misleading/illogical things.

	* dvipdfmx.c, dvi.[ch]:
	  DVI specials related to page/paper size is pre-scanned.

	* dvipdfmx.c:
	  Page selection option "-s" accept page labels.
	  For example, command line option "-s 1-10/r,11-12/D:2:empty-page-,13-"
	  set page labels for page 1-10 to lowercase roman numerals, page 11-12
	  to arabic numerals starting with 2 and with prefix "empty-page-",...

	* dvipdfmx.c:
	  An option for "bookmark open lavel" -O.

	* pdfdoc.c:
	  Undocumented watermark/page decoration feature. Not completed yet.

	* thumbnail.c:
	  I can hardly think that thumbnail support is useful. Acrobat Reader
	  can create thumbnail image and other PDF viewers like gs* and Xpdf
	  doesn't support it. Currently broken due to changes in pngimage.c.

	* dvipdfmx.c, pdfdev.c:
	  The default precision set back to 2 fractional digits. Most sensitive
	  part is dev_set_string() but the accuracy of this part is essentially
	  limited to 0.01 point in the most cases. Increasing precision above 2
	  does not give good result (except DVI rules) but merely increases file
	  size.

2004-03-05  Shunsaku Hirata

	* pdfdoc.c:
	  Fixed a critical bug introduced on change 2004-02-29:

	  very inaccurate result due to incorrect choice of scale/unit.
	  It should be fixed now. 

2004-02-29  Shunsaku Hirata

	* pdfspecial, pdfdoc, pdfobj, pdfparse:

2004-02-16  Shunsaku Hirata

	* type1.c, type1c.c, cidtype0.c:
	  Remove UniqueID and XUID from CFF Top dict.

	* type1.c:
	  Keep original FontBBox instead of replacing it with tight one obtained

	* Strip out bad strings form PostScript names;
	  -WIN-RKSJ-H, -WINP-RKSJ-H, -WING-RKSJ-H, and -90pv-RKSJ-H.
	  Some font uses PostScript name one of above strings appended,
	  even if Shift-JIS encoding is not used.

2001-11-18  Shunsaku Hirata

	* Workaround for Omega: Omega uses setxxx (single-byte char) command
	  while double-byte font is in use. Pass character type to
	  dev_set_string() to distinguish single-byte and double-byte.
	  Maybe, it works with CJK-LaTeX by preparing set of CMaps.

	* Write double-byte strings as hex strings.
	  This makes bit faster and tend to generate smaller PDF in most cases.

	* CMap parser uses wrok_buffer in mfileio.

	* Reserved w_array and w2_array in struct cid_font for future use.

	* Now write /W array for TrueType, proportional latin and kana works
	  properly. The metric information are taken from font file, not from
	  TFM, to ensure we always have correct widths. The default width (DW)
	  is set to 1000.

	* Changed sizeof() appeared in sfnt_put_xxx() to expected values in
	  sfnt.h. I do not assume LONG to be exactly 32-bit long, ....

2001-11-17  Shunsaku Hirata

	* Added Chinese and Korean related stuff again. Chinese and Korean
	  languages are supported through Omega, or by achieving Ascii pTeX
	  compatibility.

	* Closing CMaps is missing. Added cmap_close_all(), which is invoked by
	  dev_close_all_fonts() in pdfdev.c.

	* Check length of output string for Type 0 font. It must be multiple of
	  2. Omega uses 8-bit and 16-bit mixed string even for double-byte
	  fonts. This causes problems.

	* Abort if missing/invalid character is used.

2001-11-15  Shunsaku Hirata

	* Bug fixes.

2001-11-12  Shunsaku Hirata
