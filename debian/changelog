    - (patch-dvi2tty, patch-lacheck) Ken Brown <kbrow1i@gmail.com> has noteda
    that already moderately long pathnames may yield buffer overruns in 
    lacheck and dvi2tty.
    - (patch-icu) three ICU library files have been modified (undoing ICU 
    SVN commit 36090 from 2009-06-11), in order to solve all/most XeTeX 
    problems with Indic scripts.
    - (patch-pdftex) a small change in pdftexdir/pdftosrc.cc required to
    build pdfTeX with poppler >=0.18.4 (system-xpdf).  Note, however, that 
    building pdfTeX that way slightly reduces its capability to handle large 
    files (see README.config 1.6 and 3.4.2).

      [mixed executables]

  * The texlive-bin source package is now handled independently from the
    other TeXLive source packages, i.e. it is not configured in
    tpm2deb.cfg in our svn repository and the debian directory. Instead,
    it now looks more like a standard compiled package and should be
    easier to work on in case of security uploads or NMUs.
  * This also means that some of it's older binary packages, like
    texlive-metapost, have moved source package. By chance, this closes:
    #517600, #517601
  * Support a create-orig-source target in debian/rules.  The orig.tar.gz
    is now either wget'ed if we are working on a released version, or
    automatically created from a svn repository for development
  * There are now only three binary packages, texlive-binaries and the two
    library packages.  texlive-binaries Replaces/Conflicts/Provides
    texlive-base-bin in order to get a working (if not smooth)
    transition. 
  * Add Build-Depends: time, since the upstream Build script uses it
  * Don't install the format links, they will generated by dh_installtex
    in the other packages, also do not install the man pages for the 
    links
  * do not install rungs, it is not necessary
  * do not install script links, they will be shipped together with
    the script itself
  * Add patch 60_unneeded_linking. These needs testing!

  [ أحمد المحمودي (Ahmed El-Mahmoudy) ]
  * debian/rules: use /usr/share/quilt/quilt.make provided by quilt and remove 
    patch-stamp & unpatch targets

  * add texlive-binaries.prerm to remove the alternative
  * add same version number to libkpathsea-dev deps on libkpathsea5 to make

  * make texlive-binaries replace/conflict/provide dvipdfmx (in accordance
    with the maintainer of dvipdfmx we will phase out dvipdfmx itself)
  * new source package format "3.0 (quilt)" can be used (closes: #538557)
  * Install copyright file

  * include sfd files necessary for other packages, but removed from

      transition.

      the TDS-locations below /etc/texmf

      21b_pdftex_cjkfonts_overflow, 51_fmtutil_tempdir_in_texinputs

  * Apply patch from upstream to pdftex that allows it to work properly
    with CJK fonts with their large number of subfonts.  Many thanks to
    Thanh Han The <hanthethanh@gmail.com>, Jie Luo

    debugging, in particular Danai SAE-HAN (韓達耐)
