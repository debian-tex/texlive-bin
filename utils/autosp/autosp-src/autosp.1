.SH NAME
autosp \- preprocessor to generate note-spacing commands for MusiXTeX scores

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B autosp 
.RB  [ \-v\ |\ \-\-version\ |\ \-h\ |\ \-\-help ]

.B autosp
.RB [ \-d\ |\ \-\-dotted ]
.RB [ \-l\ |\ \-\-log ]
.IR infile [\ \fR.aspc\fP\ |\ \fR.tex\fP\ ]
.RI [ outfile [ \fR.tex\fP ]]


This program makes it easier to create MusiXTeX scores by converting (non-standard) commands of the 
form \\anotes ... \\en into one or more conventional
note-spacing commands (\\notes \\Notes \\NOtes ...), 
determined by the actual note values, with \\sk spacing commands inserted as necessary.
The coding
for an entire measure can be entered one part at a time, 
without
concern for note-spacing changes within the part or spacing requirements of other parts.

For example, if applied to
.nf

    \\anotes\\qa J\\qa K&\\ca l\\qa m\\ca n\\en 

.fi
.B autosp
generates
.nf

    \\Notes\\qa J\\sk\\qa K\\sk&\\ca l\\qa m\\sk\\ca n\\en

.fi
Typically,
an
\\anotes command is expanded into several conventional
note-spacing commands.

If the
.I infile
argument
has .tex extension, 
.B autosp
will process conventional note-spacing commands
(but not \\vnotes or \\znotes) 
similarly. 
This is intended to 
correct spacing in an extracted single-instrument part,
but may not produce satisfactory output when applied to a conventional multi-instrument MusiXTeX score.

If the 
.I infile
argument 
has neither .aspc nor .tex extension, input is taken from 
.IR infile .aspc 
if that file exists, or from 
.IR infile .tex 
otherwise.

For
\\anotes commands (and, for a .tex file, all conventional note-spacing commands), 
line breaks and spaces may precede note segments, allowing more flexible source formatting; 
the line breaks and spaces will be elided from the output. 

For example, 
.nf

  \\anotes
    \\ibl0K0\\qb0K\\nbbl0\\qb0{.K}\\tbbbl0\\tbbl0\\tql0L&
    \\ibbl1m{-2}\\qb1{.m}\\tbbbl1\\tbbl1\\qb1l\\tql1k\\en

.fi
is acceptable and generates
.nf

  \\notesp\\ibl0K0\\qb0K&\\ibbl1m{-2}\\qb1{.m}\\en
  \\nnotes\\sk&\\tbbbl1\\tbbl1\\qb1l\\en
  \\notesp\\nbbl0\\qb0{.K}&\\tql1k\\en
  \\nnotes\\tbbbl0\\tbbl0\\tql0L&\\sk\\en

.fi


If
no 
.IR outfile
argument is provided, 
output goes to
.IR infile .tex 
if the 
.I infile 
name
has extension .aspc, or to standard output otherwise.

If the 
.B \-l 
( \fB\-\-log\fP ) option is used, a log 
.IR infile .alog
is generated.

If the 
.B \-d  
( \fB--dotted\fP )
option is used, 
.I dotted 
beam notes of the form \\qb{\fIn\fP}{\fB.\fP\fIp\fP} are 
.I not 
given extra space;
it is assumed that the subsequent note will be shifted
by 
a \\roff-like command 
or a spacing command such as \\qsk or \\hqsk.
Commands of the form \\qlp{\fIp\fP}, \\qlpp{\fIp\fP}, ..., \\qpb{\fIn\fP}{\fIp\fP} and 
\\qppb{\fIn\fP}{\fIp\fP} are always spaced
as indicated. 

If there is a single staff, consecutive whole-bar rest bars
are merged into a multi-bar rest. Bar-centered rests can be
coded using the standard \\def\\atnextbar notation but also
the non-standard command \\Cpause in a note segment generates a
bar-centered rest.

Spacing commands \\sk and \\hsk in the source are discarded,
but not \\qsk, \\hqsk or \\qqsk;
moreover
non-standard commands
\\Qsk, \\HQsk and \\QQsk generate "global" skips; i.e., the effect of \\qsk, \\hqsk or \\qqsk in 
.I every 
staff.

A note segment can be completely empty, but if a note segment should start
with or contain a "space," the note-value
of that space must be made explicit with a command of the
form \\ha{*}, \\qa{.*}, \\qa{*}, \\ca{*}, etc. 

All other conventional MusiXTeX commands are output exactly as given in the input.


.SH OPERATION

.B autosp
determines the spacing for ordinary notes from the note
commands themselves; for example, 
.TP 3
+
\\qa, \\qu, \\ql, \\qp result in
\\NOtes; 
.TP 3
+
\\ca, \\cu, \\cl, \\ds result in \\Notes; 
.PP
and so on. 
 
The spacing for 
.IR beamed 
notes is determined by the beam
multiplicity, so that \\ib... results in \\Notes, \\ibb... results in
\\notes, etc. 

Collective coding of note sequences (including accidentals and dots) is handled 
by expanding the sequence
into a sequence of individual note commands.

.SH LIMITATIONS

.B autosp
assumes that & and | (rather than \\nextinstrument and \\nextstaff) are used to separate instruments and staffs.


Appoggiaturas and grace notes are recognized by the use of \\tinynotesize; note-spacing
of 1.45\\elemskip is used. If this isn't suitable and can't be corrected with a small skip, a
\\vnotes command with any desired spacing can be used.

.B autosp 
supports 
.I x-tuplets 
introduced using \\xtuplet{\fIx\fP}
and 
.I triplets 
introduced
using any of the following commands (regardless of any re-definition of \\txt or \\tuplettxt):
.nf

  \\triolet
  \\uptrio
  \\downtrio
  \\uptuplet
  \\downtuplet

.fi
However,
MusiXTeX notation does not 
specify the 
.I intended 
duration of an x-tuplet.
.B autosp 
assumes that an x-tuplet is to be played in 
(\fIx\fP\-1)/\fIx\fP 
of the apparent x-tuplet duration.
So, for example, a triplet in eighths is assumed to be played in the time of one quarter note.
If this assumption
isn't valid, the x-tuplet must
be coded explicitly using a \\vnotes command; see the first
measure of barsant2.aspc for an example of a non-standard x-tuplet: a 5-tuple 
of 64th notes with an intended duration
of 
.I six 
64ths.
.B autosp
cannot deal with simultaneous x-tuplets in multiple staffs unless the x values and
note durations are identical. Global skips (\\QQsk, \\HQsk and \\Qsk) are
ineffective if a staff has an x-tuplet; however, "local" skips (\\qqsk, \\hqsk, \\qsk)
are effective.

User-defined macros are not processed or expanded.

All staffs are assumed to have the same meter; see kinder2.aspc for
an example of how to work around this.

.B autosp
may not be effective for music with more than one voice in a single staff. It might be
advisable to use a separate staff for each voice, to avoid \\anotes when necessary, 
or to omit certain voices
initially and add them into the resulting TeX file.
