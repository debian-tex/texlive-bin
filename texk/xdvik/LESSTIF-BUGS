Bugs of current xdvik with LessTif
==================================

This is a list of known bugs if current xdvik is compiled with
lesstif-0.93.18 (in decreasing severity).

Some of them may be bugs in xdvik, others bugs with LessTif. Currently
I don't have time and/or deeper knowledge of X to look into them.
People who are annoyed by these bugs should use either OpenMotif, or
the Xaw version of xdvik instead. Ideas and tips are welcome ...

- Page list: Toggling expert mode or the page list produces strange
  results when page list is switched on again: List appears too wide
  (hides part of horizontal scrollbar) and too short. When the page
  list preference is set to 'Off', the pagelist is displayed
  nevertheless (#1493853).

- Main window layout: window is too narrow when starting in expert
  mode (e.g. 80x900) and too wide (entire screen) in non-expert mode.
  Workaround: Use -geometry argument to force a sensible window size.

- Removing the scrollbars in expert mode doesn't work.

- Newline character `\n' in LabelGadget texts doesn't cause a line
  break. Workaround: Xdvi uses shorter labels when compiled with LessTif.

- Spinbox replacement in LessTif looks ugly. Workaround: Xdvi
  doesn't use Spinbox when compiled with LessTif.

- Preferences window: Headings list (left window) is a few pixels
  too small, cutoff of longest title. The list has a horizontal
  scrollbar even though it's not needed, and the part that is
  cut off can't be scrolled to. Workaround: Use extra trailing
  whitespace for longest title in LessTif.
