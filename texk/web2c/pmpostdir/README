This directory contains pMetaPost and upMetaPost, a Japanese version
of MetaPost. They were originally published/maintained as jMetaPost
by Michio Matsuyama and Hideyuki Suzuki.

A few years later, the changes files were translated from WEB to
CWEB by Akira Kakuto for W32TeX distribution. The project name
was changed to pMetaPost around 2009, to be consistent with pTeX
and upTeX. The command names are currently pmpost and upmpost.

Old information and development history (around 1999) can be obtained
