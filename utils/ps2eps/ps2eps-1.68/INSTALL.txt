INSTALLATION 
------------

* Prerequisites
  you need:
  - perl (an interpreter for the perl language, see http://www.perl.com)
  - ghostscript (an interpreter/raster image processor 
                 for the PostScript language,
                 see http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/)
  - maybe an ANSI-C compiler if the provided binaries for bbox do not work
    for you. Sorry for the inconvenience, but I tried to write a bbox 
    equivalent in perl and it was terribly slow. Therefore I stick to C, 
    because of much better performance.
    ALTERNATIVELY you can use ps2eps option -g, then no bbox binary is 
    required.

* How to install

  Please check that you have working
  perl and ghostscript packages.

  Linux/UNIX-based platform
  =========================
  1.) install bbox

  If a bbox binary is included for your platform you simply move it
  into any directory of the system search path. Otherwise, you have
  to compile bbox.c first by invoking 
  cc -o bbox bbox.c. 
  (sometimes "make bbox" also works).
  Please make sure that bbox is executable (chmod a+x bbox).
  If you already have a working perl and a working ghostscript, you're 
  finished here, else you have to install them first.

  2.) install ps2eps
  On Unix platforms you simply move the perl script ps2eps into
  a directory which is included in the system or personal search 
  path (e.g., /usr/local/bin, $home/bin). Please make sure that
  ps2eps is executable (chmod a+x ps2eps).

  Windows-based platform
  ======================
  Use the command line interpreter:
  Copy bbox.exe from bin/win32/ directory into a directory that is 
  in your's or the system's search path for executables. Please try 
  to invoke bbox -h afterwards.

  The best possibility is to use associated file types under 
  Windows NT/2000/XP:
  1.) rename ps2eps to ps2eps.pl and 
  2.) SET PATHEXT=.pl;%PATHEXT% or use the 
      settings -> control panel -> system -> "advanced" tab -> environment variables
      and edit the PATHEXT entry accordingly.
  3.) then simply typing ps2eps should invoke ps2eps correctly 

  Another option is to call perl directly:
  perl ps2eps ...
  
  The script assumes that you have "gswin32c" as 
  postscript interpreter in your path. Under Windows ps2eps
  can perform wildcard expansion now on its own.
