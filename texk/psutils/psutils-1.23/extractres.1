.TH EXTRACTRES 1 "PSUtils"
.SH NAME
extractres \- filter to extract resources from a PostScript document
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B extractres 
.RB [ \-m ]
.RI < document.ps
.RI > output.ps
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Extractres
extracts resources (fonts, procsets, patterns, files, etc) appearing in a
PostScript document, and puts appropriate
.B %%IncludeResource
comments in the document prologue. The extracted resources are written to
files with the same name as the resource, and an appropriate extension. The
pipeline
.sp
.ce
extractres file.ps | includeres >out.ps
.sp
will move all resources appearing in a document to the document prologue,
removing redundant copies. The output file can then be put through page
re-arrangement filters such as
.B psnup
or 
.B pstops
safely.
.PP
The
.B \-m
option combines the resources of the same name into one file; this must be
used for some programs which download fonts a bit at a time.
