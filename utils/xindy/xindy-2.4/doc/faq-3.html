<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 What is <CODE>tex2xindy</CODE>?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P><CODE>tex2xindy</CODE> is a filter that parses `<CODE>.idx</CODE>' or similar files
and converts the <CODE>\indexentry</CODE> macros into a form readable by
<SF>xindy</SF>.
<P>The parser of <CODE>makeindex</CODE> can be configured to recognize different
quoting characters, etc. (see the man-page for <CODE>makeindex</CODE>, section
<EM>input style specifiers</EM> for further details). We have tried to
extract the parser from <CODE>makeindex</CODE> but due to several probems we
have finally rewritten the parser using <CODE>lex</CODE>. Scanners written
with <CODE>lex</CODE> are usually fixed to a specific character set used in
the regular expressions. Our parser, <CODE>tex2xindy</CODE> is therefore not
configurable. If one uses a different configuration of the
<CODE>makeindex</CODE> input style specifiers, one can change the source
(<CODE>tex2xindy.l</CODE>) to generate a completely new parser. From our
personal experience we have rarely used more than two different
parsers in practice so we have written <CODE>tex2xindy</CODE> in a form that
is easily maintainable. The input specifiers are stored symbolically
in the source. The definiton section looks like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
KEYWORD  \\indexentry
ENCAP    \|
ACTUAL   @
ESCAPE   \\
LEVEL    !
QUOTE    \"
ROPEN    \(
RCLOSE   \)
ARGOPEN  \{
ARGCLOSE \}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These definitions are essentially the input style specifiers as can be
found in the man-page of <CODE>makeindex</CODE>. Changing this section
according to your needs and recompiling <CODE>tex2xindy</CODE> should be an
easy task. Maybe we will include more pre-defined parsers in future
releases if necessary.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 What LaTeX-package should I use in conjunction with xindy?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>We strongly recommend using the LaTeX2e-package <CODE>index</CODE> written
by David M. Jones, which is available at CTAN. It supports multiple
indexes as well as several shortcuts to easily index terms in a
document. Multiple indexes support the generation of several indexes
for one document. For instance, one can make an author or command
index in addition to a global index.
<P>Another option is to use the <CODE>xindy.sty</CODE> from Andreas Schlechte
that comes with the <SF>xindy</SF> distribution. Take a look at the
<CODE>contrib</CODE> directory that should contain a version.
