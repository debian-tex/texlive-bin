version 2020-06-03:

Improvements to Oberon sources:

* Remove unused variables and procedures.

* Explicitly initialise each local variable.

* Delete occasional empty declarations -- VAR with no variables declared

* Declare 'notes' (Testbed) as an array of *pointers* to NoteDesc; add
  to NotesProp the call
  
    NEW(notes[ps, voice, measure, note]);

* Add ^ to one call of WriteNote2PMX:

    WriteNote2PMX( W, notes[ps, voice, measure, note]^, ps, voice,
                   voicefrom, measure, note, Dtext, Rtext, istuplet );  

* Add tests for notes[p, v, m, n] = NIL in four places: l.293, l.771,
  l.1411, l.1435

* In Testbed, increase the size of the following string buffers to 32:

  tremolotype (l.138); tremolo, blindrest (l.928); number (l.1580);
  cautionary, editorial, parentheses (l.2206); defaultxs (l.2312).

* Only print clefspec[i] if it is non-null:

    IF clefspec[i] # 0X THEN Out.Char( clefspec[i] ) END;  

________________________________________________________________________

Changes to compile with OBC:

* Delete procedures PrintRange (two places), which refer to Scanner module

* Use modules String1 and MyFiles in place of Strings0 and Files.  Use
  Out directly, eliminating references to LCout.

* Add TYPE LONGINT = INTEGER at the head of each file.

* Use Args in place of Kernel in Testbed module.

Changes to runtime to allow compilation with gcc -std=c90 -Wall -pedantic
