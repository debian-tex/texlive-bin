$Id$
Public domain.  Originally written 2010 by Karl Berry.

This directory contains things which are not part of the TeX Live build,
but only present for convenience.

bibtex is here because Oren wanted a central place for the core styles.

epstopdf is developed here just because we didn't feel like making a
separate repository.

djgpp support here is probably obsolete, but just in case.
