.SH DESCRIPTION
pmxab is a preprocessor for MusiXTeX.
It's usually invoked by a frontend musixtex(1).
To use it to its full benefit you should have installed MusiXTeX Version 1.21
or higher, and TeX itself.
The goal of PMX is to faciliate the efficient typesetting of scores and parts
that have an almost professional appearance. To learn more about typesetting
with PMX, please read the PMX Manual.

When invoked directly, pmxab produces tex output utilizing the MusiXTeX
macro set.
