      environments.

   Fixed a problem in t1part for the Euro fonts with partial font downloading.
   Fixed a big problem in t1part for some font downloading due to
      uninitialized allocations.

dvips 5.74 notes:

   The epsf.sty and epsf.tex files are now in the public domain.
   The t1part.c has been updated to support binary files with
       multiple binary sections.

dvips 5.72 notes:

   Bug fix in t1part.c???  I hope so!

   Debugging now turned on by default.  No real reason to turn it off.
   (Too many Linux versions of dvips without debugging have been
   distributed, and it makes it very difficult to help the users with
   their problems . . .)

dvips 5.62 notes:

   The makefile and config.ps and MakeTeXPK need to be modified to fit
   your site!
