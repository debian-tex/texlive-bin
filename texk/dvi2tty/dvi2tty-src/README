                DVI2TTY


dvi2tty is intended for previewing dvi-files on text-only
devices (terminals and lineprinters).
The program is basically an improved C version of the pascal
program written by Svante Lindahl (see README.ORG).
I translated it because I could not find a pascal compiler 
on our machine that could compile it.
The program runs under UNIX and MSDOS without problems
It should also run under VMS. 
(you may need some site dependend redefinitions, see below).


                DISDVI

Disdvi is a simple hack that dumps a dvi file in a more readable form.
It is not a spectacular program but use it and improve as you wish.
I'd appreciate any enhancements made, bug reports etc. mailed to me.
  

    COMPILING THE PROGRAMS

Disdvi is rather simple and does not need any modifications.
To compile under VMS, you might need to define an extra macro:
Add a -DVMS on the command line, or add a line
    #define VMS
in the dvi2tty.h file.
For dvi2tty you may find the following problems:

 function strchr() can not be found:
      Your are probably a BSD UNIX or alike.
      Solution: #define strchr index
 '/usr/bin/pg' program not found.
      Solution: change the DEFPAGER macro in dvi2tty.c

When set, just type:

	make

to build disdvi and dvi2tty

dvi2tty is licensed under the GPL version 2. It has had a history of many
authors, I am just one of the latest maintainers.

Thats all, good luck.
