Release notes for version 1.15 of the dvipng package:

This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from TeX
and its relatives.


This is a bugfix release that removes the unnecessarily long delay in --follow
mode and a few segfaults on out-of-memory or missing standard-latex files, and
adds some documentation improvements. It also removes support for libt1, which
is reportedly not developed anymore, and not needed since Freetype does a much
better job.


Report any bugs you find, see README for instructions.
