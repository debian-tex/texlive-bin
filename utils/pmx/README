In order to build pmx we don't need the complete libf2c library. 
Specifically, we can omit uninit.c and with it the necessity to build and
run arithchk in order to create the arith.h header file (which would make
cross compilation impossible).

From all the preprocessor defines arithchk could generate we only might need
'VAX' (most probably irrelevant) and 'NO_LONG_LONG' which can be handled by
the configure script.  Thus an empty file arith.h suffices.

================

Actually, compiling neither signbit.c nor uninit.c the file arith.h is not
used at all and can bbe omitted.
