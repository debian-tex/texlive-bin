This file records only bugs that have been tagged as `Wont fix' or
`Later', i.e. bugs that couldn't be resolved so far.

Please report new bugs to the above SourceForge URL, including as much
information as possible (whatever may be relevant: platform, compiler,
X version, output of xdpyinfo, sample .dvi file to reproduce the
problem; see also: http://xdvi.sourceforge.net/#bugs).


(A) X interface bugs:

(A1) The current code to toggle to/from fullscreen mode via Ctrl-l, and to
     remove the Xaw scrollbars for expert mode is an atrocious hack that won't
     work with many window managers (see e.g. #814327). These should be fixed by
     someone who knows X better than I do.

(A2) The correct handling of XtAppAddTimeOut() and friends, used e.g. internally
     by many Motif widgets, depends on xdvi redefining the XtAppAddTimeOut() and
     related functions to use its own non-standard event handling routines.
   
     If this is not possible (e.g. because your linker doesn't allow multiple
     definitions - check for the corresponding warnings by ./configure),
     some of the widgets (e.g. the print log window, tooltips, statusline
     messages, hyperlink location markers) will not appear correctly or will
     only be updated when the mouse is moved.

(A3) Motif: Toggle buttons in print dialog (page range) may fail under
     certain circumstances when button has been changed via marking pages.
     (For details, see comment in gui/print-dialog.c, notify_dialog()).

(A4) Motif 1.2: After opening a document at page 1 and changing to page
     2, an partial area of the highlighting of page 1 is not erased (#997080).

(A5) Ctrl-l and the `fullscreen' option are hacks that may interact badly
     with certain window managers (e.g. KDE; see #815020). In such cases it's
     better to use the window manager's functions to enable fullscreen mode.

(A6) Xaw: The page list scroll area (viewport) is not resized when switching to
     a file with longer page numbers (e.g. from 2-digit ones to 5-digit ones).


(B) Known features:

(B1) Controll of font/file generation by X-resource and commandline is overridden
     by controll by environment variable/texmf.cnf setting.  This is a design
     decision in kpathsea; if you want it to be resource/commandline controlled,
     make sure there is no setting in the environment or texmf.cnf.
  
(B2) Some of the optional compilation stuff (e.g. display postscript) hasn't been
     tested for quite some time and may be broken.


(C) Autoconfigure issues:

(C1) GS_PATH cannot be set except by CFLAGS=-DGS_PATH=...  Paul has a macro for
     this.  Must be compatible with kpathsea, but I haven't checked this yet.
