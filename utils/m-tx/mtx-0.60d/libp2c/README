The GNU License Agreement restrictions do _not_ apply to code generated

NO WARRANTY:
   The program in this directory was developed for internal use at
   Caltech and thus absolutely no guarantee is made that the program
   will compile or run on other systems or that it will produce correct
   code.  P2c is _not_ a compiler, it is a translator; it strives to
   produce correct code but reserves the right to sacrifice correctness
   in extreme cases for readability in the general case.  P2c is designed
   to be extended (see funcs.c, hpmods.c and citmods.c for examples), but
   some of the main code is pretty messy since the translator has grown
   considerably beyond its original planned scale.  Bug reports are
   welcome at daveg@synaptics.com, but I may not have time to respond
   to them immediately.  Suggestions are welcome, too!
