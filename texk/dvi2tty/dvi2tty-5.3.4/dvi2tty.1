.TH DVI2TTY 1 "13 November 1990"
.SH NAME
dvi2tty \- preview a TeX DVI\-file on an ordinary ascii terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dvi2tty
[ options ] dvi\-file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I dvi2tty
converts a TeX DVI\-file to a format that is appropriate for terminals
and line printers. The program is intended to be used for
preliminary proofreading of TeX-ed documents.
By default the output is directed to the terminal,
possibly through a pager (depending on how the program was installed),
but it can be directed to a file or a pipe.
.PP
The output leaves much to be desired, but is still
useful if you want to avoid walking to the
laser printer (or whatever) for each iteration of your
document.
.br
Since
.I dvi2tty
produces output for terminals and line printers the
representation of documents is naturally quite primitive.
In principle Font Changes are totally ignored, but
.I dvi2tty
recognizes
a few mathematical and special symbols that can be be displayed on an
ordinary ascii terminal, such as the '+' and '-' symbol.
.PP
If the width of the output text requires more columns than fits
in one line (c.f. the \-w option) it is broken into several lines by
.I dvi2tty
although they will be printed as one line on regular TeX output
devices (e.g. laser printers). To show that a broken line is really
just one logical line an asterisk (``*'') in the last position
means that the logical line is continued on the next physical
line output by
.I dvi2tty.
Such a continuation line is started with a a space and an asterisk
in the first two columns.
.PP
Options may be specified in the environment variable DVI2TTY.
Any option on the command line, conflicting with one in the
environment, will override the one from the environment.
.PP
.B Options:
.PP
.TP
.B \-o file
Write output to file ``file''.
.TP
.B \-p list
Print the pages chosen by list.
Numbers refer to TeX\-page numbers (known as \\count0).
An example of format for list is ``1,3:6,8''
to choose pages 1, 3 through 6 and 8.
Negative numbers can be used exactly as in TeX,
e g \-1 comes before \-4 as in ``\-p\-1:\-4,17''.
.TP
.B \-P list
Like \-p except that page numbers refer to
the sequential ordering of the pages in the dvi\-file.
Negative numbers don't make a lot of sense here...
.TP
.B \-w n
Specify terminal width
.I n.
Legal range 16\-132.
Default is 80. If your terminal has the
ability to display in 132 columns it might
be a good idea to use \-w132 and toggle the
terminal into this mode as output will
probably look somewhat better.
.TP
.B \-v
Specify height of lines. Default value 450000. Allows to adjust linespacing.
.TP
.B \-q
Don't pipe the output through a pager.
This may be the default on some systems
(depending on the whims of the person installing the program).
.TP
.B \-e n
This option can be used to influence the spacing between words.
With a negative value the number of spaces 
between words becomes less, with a positive value it becomes more.
\-e\-11 seems to worked well.
.TP
.B \-f
Pipe through a pager, $PAGER if defined, or whatever the installer of
the program compiled
in (often ``more''). This may be the default, but it is still okay
to redirect output with ``>'', the pager will not be used if output
is not going to a terminal.
.TP
.B \-F
Specify the pager program to be used.
This overrides the $PAGER and the default pager.
.TP
.B \-Fprog
Use ``prog'' as program to pipe output into. Can be used to choose an
alternate pager (e g ``-Fless'').
.TP
.B \-t
\\tt fonts were used (instead of cm) to produce dvi file. (screen.sty
is a powerfull mean to do that with LaTeX).
.TP
.B \-a
Dvi2tty normally tries to output accented characters. With the -a option,
accented characters are output without the accent sign.
.TP
.B \-l
Mark page breaks with the two-character sequence ``^L''. The default is
to mark them with a form-feed character.
.TP
.B \-c
Do not attempt to translate any characters (like the Scandinavion/latin1 mode)
except when running in tt-font.
.TP
.B \-u
Toggle option to process certain latin1 characters. Use this if your output
devices supports latin1 cahracters.
Note this may interfere with -s. Best not to use -u and -s together.
.TP
.B \-s
Toggle option to process the special Scandinavian characters that on most (?)
terminals in Scandinavia are mapped to ``{|}[\\]''.
Note this may interfere with -u. Best not to use -u and -s together.
.TP
.B \-J
Auto detect NTT JTeX, ASCII pTeX, and upTeX dvi format.
.TP
.B \-N
Display NTT JTeX dvi.
.TP
.B \-A
Display ASCII pTeX dvi.
.TP
.B \-U
Display upTeX dvi.
.TP
.B \-Eenc
Set output Japanese encoding. The enc argument 'e', 's', 'j', and 'u'
denotes EUC-JP, Shift_JIS, ISO-2022-JP, and UTF-8, respectively.
.TP
.B \-bdelim
Print the name of fonts when switching to it (and ending it). The delim
argument is used to delimit the fontname.
.SH FILES
/bin/more \ \ \ \ 
probably the default pager.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
PAGER \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 
the pager to use.
.br
DVI2TTY \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 
can be set to hold command-line options.

.SH BUGS
Blanks between words get lost quite easy. This is less
likely if you are using a wider output than the default 80.
.PP
Only one file may be specified on the command line.
