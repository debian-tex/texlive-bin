xpdfopen 0.86 - Send open/close commands to Acrobat Reader, xpdf and evince
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a Linux (X11) implementation of Fabrice Popineau's pdfclose/
pdfopen commands to control Acrobat Reader, xpdf and evince.

The libX code was borrowed from Reinhard Fobbe's Sendx library for 
Tcl/Tk, and the programs use the same license, copied below. 

Version 0.3 adds support for Adobe Reader 7.0 for Linux.
            (different window titles and key shortcuts)

Version 0.4 uses autoconf

Version 0.5 fixes an incorrect autoconf variable, supports building
            under X11R5, handles pathnames on the command-line, and
            fixes a bug where pdfopen did not exit correctly after
            (automatically) starting acroread.

Version 0.51 uses the strrchr() function instead of rindex() 
             to allow compilation on non-BSD derived unix platforms.

Version 0.61 attempts to do something useful with Adobe Reader 8,
             even though it is impossible to restore the viewport.

Version 0.80 adds an implementation for AR 9 and xpdf.

Version 0.81 adds an implementation for evince.

Version 0.82 adds a man page and -v/--version options for pdfopen.

Version 0.83 adds the -r/-reset_focus option for pdfopen.

Version 0.84 adds 'load at given page' support (-p option) for Adobe
             Reader 9, evince (at least 3.12, maybe earlier) and xpdf.

Version 0.85 adds 'load at named destination' support (-g/--goto option)
             for xpdf, evince and (supposedly) AR9.  The AR9 man page
             claims it should work, but it doesn't for me.  I left
             the allegedly-correct code there anyway, in case it works
             for other people in other places.
             Also add aliases for option names to make ms-windows
             users feel at home.

Version 0.86 fixes 'load at named destination' for AR9.


The AR command lines do not behave precisely the same as under Windows, 
because the Linux Reader behaves somewhat differently: it is not 
scriptable, but it is possible to 'fake' key-presses.


pdfopen has the following call sequence:
	pdfopen [-r|-reset_focus] \
		[-viewer/--viewer <ar9|ar9-tab|ar8|ar7|ar5|xpdf|evince>] \
                [-p/--page <page number>] \
                [-g/--goto <named destination>] \
                [--file] <pdf file name>

The "ar9" version uses AR9's "-openInNewInstance" option, the "ar9-tab"
version does not (so if there is already an AR9 window open, a new tab
will be opened in that window).


pdfclose has the following call sequence:
	pdfclose [--file] <pdf file name>
This program closes an existing AR5, AR7, AR8, AR9, xpdf or evince window
displaying the given PDF file.


Version 0.85 compiles on Linux (Slackware64 14.1, anyway) with
the following command:
	gcc -Wall pdfopen.c sendx.c utils.c -o pdfopen -lX11 -s
	gcc -Wall pdfclose.c sendx.c utils.c -o pdfclose -lX11 -s
should you not want to go through the process of creating and running
a configure program.
