.SH NAME
bbox \- prints out the bounding box of a rawppm or rawpbm image
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBbbox\fR [ \fB-l\fR ] [ \fB-r\fR ] [ \fB-h\fR ] [ \fB-V\fR ] [ \fB\fIrawpbmfile\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBbbox\fR reads a rawppm or rawpbm file
and prints out the bounding box of the image (as postscript comment and
in postscript points, i.e. 1/72dpi) as well as the high resolution
bounding box. Input is read from standard input if no filename is
specified.
Example output:

.nf
	  %%BoundingBox: 12 253 829 837
	  %%HiResBoundingBox: 12.500000 253.000000 828.500000 837.00000
	  
.fi
.PP
\fBbbox\fR has only very limited memory requirements
as it reads the input line by line and thus needs to store only one picture
line in memory.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-h | --help \fR

.TP
\fB-V \fR

.TP
\fB-r \fR
resolution of picture in dpi
