This directory contains Dvips, Tom Rokicki's dvips, a DVI-to-PostScript
translator.  It requires the Kpathsea library for path searching.

See `NEWS' for changes by release, `ChangeLog` for all changes.
See `../kpathsea/BUGS' for details on reporting bugs.

Dvips is free software; Tom's original files are public domain.  The
files Karl wrote (originally for the Free Software Foundation) are
covered by the GNU General Public License -- see the files COPYING*.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The documentation is in the file dvips.texi.

You can read and run the file testdata/dvipstst.tex that to test some
basic capabilities of dvips.  Some of the other files in testdata:
intoverflow.dvi (CVE-2010-0739)
vfnameoverflow.dvi (CVE-2010-0827)
See also the *.test* scripts.

If you enjoy using dvips, you will probably enjoy being a member of 
the TeX Users Group.  To join or contribute to TUG, see http://tug.org.

This is a list of people who have contributed substantially to dvips.
I'm sure I've forgotten many.  Thanks to all!
