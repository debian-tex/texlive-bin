.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmendex\fR [-ilqrcgfEJSU] [\fB-s\fI sty\fR] [\fB-d\fI dic\fR] [\fB-o\fI ind\fR] [\fB-t\fI log\fR] [\fB-p\fI no\fR] [\fB-I\fI enc\fR] [\fB--help\fR] [\fB--\fR] [\fI idx0 idx1 idx2 ...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The program \fImendex\fR is a general purpose hierarchical index generator;
it accepts one or more input files (\fI.idx\fR; often produced by a text
formatter such as \*(LX), sorts the entries, and produces an output file
which can be formatted. It is almost compatible with \fImakeindex\fR, and
additional feature for handling readings of kanji words is also available.
.RE
The formats of the input and output files are specified in a style file.
The readings of kanji words can be specified in a dictionary file.
.RE
The index can have up to three levels (0, 1, and 2) of subitem nesting.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP 10
\fB-i\fR
Take input from stdin, even when index files are specified.
.TP 10
\fB-l\fR
Set \'sort by character order\'. By default, \'sort by word order\' is used.
Details are described below.
.TP 10
\fB-q\fR
Quiet mode; send no message to \fIstderr\fR, except error
messages and warnings.
.TP 10
\fB-r\fR
Disable implicit page range formation. By default, three or
more successive pages are automatically abbreviated as a range
(e.g. 1\(en5).
.TP 10
\fB-c\fR
Compress sequence of intermediate blanks (space(s) and/or tab(s)) into a space
and ignore leading and trailing blank(s).
By default, blanks in the index key are retained.
.TP 10
\fB-g\fR
Make Japanese index head \fIA\fR-line (\fIA, Ka, Sa, ...\fR) of the gojuon table (Japanese
syllabary). By default, all the characters in the gojuon table
are used.
.TP 10
\fB-f\fR
Force to output Kanji characters even non-existent in dictionaries.
.TP 10
\fB-s\fI sty\fR
Employ \fIsty\fR as the style file.
.TP 10
\fB-d\fI dic\fR
Employ \fIdic\fR as the dictionary file. The dictionary file is
composed of lists of <\fIindex_word\fR\ \fIreading\fR>.
.TP 10
\fB-o\fI ind\fR
Employ \fIind\fR as the output index file. By default, the file
name is created by appending the extension \fIind\fR to the base
name of the first input file.
.TP 10
\fB-t\fI log\fR
Employ \fIlog\fR as the transcript file. By default, the file name
is created by appending the extension \fIilg\fR to the base name
of the first input file.
.TP 10
\fB-p\fI no\fR
Set the starting page number of the output index list to be
\fIno\fR. The argument \fIno\fR may be numerical or one of
the following: \fIany\fR (the next page to the end of contents), \fIodd\fR
(the next odd page to the end of contents), \fIeven\fR (the next even page to the end of contents).
.TP 10
\fB-E\fR
Set input/output kanji encoding to EUC-JP.
.TP 10
\fB-J\fR
Set input/output kanji encoding to JIS (ISO-2022-JP).
.TP 10
\fB-S\fR
Set input/output kanji encoding to Shift_JIS.
.TP 10
\fB-U\fR
Set input/output kanji encoding to UTF-8.
.TP 10
\fB-I\fI enc\fR
Set internal encoding to \fIenc\fR. The argument \fIenc\fR
may be \fIeuc\fR (EUC-JP) or \fIutf8\fR (UTF-8).
The normal default is set to \fIeuc\fR, but the default is changed to \fIutf8\fR
when the option \fB-U\fR is specified explicitly.
.TP 10
\fB--help\fR
Show summary of options.
.TP 10
\fB--\fR
Arguments after \fB--\fR are not taken as options.

.SH "STYLE FILE"
The style file informs \fImendex\fR about the format of the
\fIidx\fR input files and the intended format of the final
output file. The format is upper compatible with the one for
\fImakeindex\fR. The style file contains a list of
<\fIspecifier\fR\ \fIattribute\fR> pairs.
There are two types of specifiers: input and output.
Pairs do not have to appear in any particular order.
A line begun by \'%\' is a comment.

.SH ABOUT JAPANESE PROCESSING
.PP
\fImendex\fR has an additional feature to simplify the procedure of handling
Japanese indexes, compared to \fImakeindex\fR. Users can save the effort
of manually specifying a reading for every kanji word.
.RE
Japanese kanji words are usually sorted by the syllables of their readings
(\fI\'Yomi\'\fR), which can be represented by kana (Hiragana, Katakana) scripts.
\fImendex\fR accepts index words specified in kana expression directly on
an input file, and also accepts conversion from index words to kana scripts
by referring to Japanese dictionaries.
.RE

.LP
Examples of internal simplification of syllables are shown below.

The dictionary file consists of list with <\'index_word\' \'reading\'>.
The index word can be written in any scripts (kanji, kana, etc),
and the reading must be in Hiragana or Katakana scripts.
The delimiter between the index word and its reading is one or more tab(s) or space(s).

Here, each index word is allowed to have only one Yomi.
Though some kanji words (ex. 「表」) may have more than one Yomi\'s
(ex. 「ひょう」 and 「おもて」), only one of them can be registered in the dictionary.
When some different Yomi\'s are needed, they should be specified explicitly
in kana expression (ex. \\index{ひょう@表} or \\index{おもて@表}) on the input file.
.RE
Moreover, a dictionary file is automatically referred
by setting the file name at an environment variable \fIINDEXDEFAULTDICTIONARY\fR.
The dictionary set by the environment variable can be used
together with file(s) specified by \fI-d\fR option.

.SH ABOUT SORTING PROCEDURE
.PP
\fImendex\fR sorts indexes as is (\'sort by word order\') by default.
Setting \fI-l\fR option, spaces between words in an index are truncated prior to
sorting procedure (\'sort by character order\').

Even when sort by character order, the index at output remains the original sequence
without the truncation.
