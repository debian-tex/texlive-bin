The optional patches to flex-2.5.31 and bison-2.0a in this directory fix a
number of problems with warning and/or error messages generated by strict
compilers.

A modified version of dvipdf that accepts common dvips options is included.

The file gcc3.3.2curses.patch can be used to patch the broken curses.h header
files (or a local copy thereof in the current directory) on some AIX and
IRIX systems.

The file gc6.8_AIX.patch fixes an incorrect Boehm garbage collector
prototype in the file gc6.8/include/gc.h (version 6.8).

The file gc-7.0nomem.patch avoids segmentation faults with gc-7.0 on
out-of-memory errors.

The file movie15_dvipdfmx.patch brings the xelatex/dvipdfmx-enhanced
version of movie15.sty available at
http://cvs.ktug.or.kr/viewcvs/dvipdfmx/contrib/latex/movie15.sty.sample?revision=1.1
up-to-date with the official 2008/10/08 version. For convenience the
patched version is also included as movie15_dvipdfmx.sty; it should be
renamed to movie15.sty and installed in the local latex directory.

The file fixmem.reg patches the Microsoft Windows registry so that the
cygwin1.dll library can allocate more than 384MB. It is applied
automatically by the Asymptote setup.exe file but may also be applied manually:
regedit/s fixmem.reg
