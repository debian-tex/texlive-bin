PostScript Utilities for TeX Live

For TeX Live we can not use paper_size() from psutil.c because the default
papersize is given in the file paper.cfg to be found somewhere in the TDS
hierarchy.  Therefore we supply our onw paper_size() in paper-size.c, using
the kpathsea library to locate that file and use that library to handle all
portability issues.
