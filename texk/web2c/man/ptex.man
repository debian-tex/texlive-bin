.SH DESCRIPTION
p\*(TX (\fBptex\fR)
is a \*(TX engine with extensions for Japanese typesetting, including
features related to line breaking rules, inter-character spacing and
vertical writing. It was first developed by ASCII Corporation, in the
aim of providing a Japanese \*(TX which can be used for commercial
publishing. For p\*(TX, the character set available is limited to
JIS X 0208, namely JIS level-1 and level-2.
.PP
up\*(TX (\fBuptex\fR)
is a Unicode-enabled p\*(TX with extensions for better handling of
CJK (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) multilingual documents.
It has been developed by Takuji Tanaka since 2007.
.PP
e-p\*(TX (\fBeptex\fR) is a merge of e-\*(TX and p\*(TX.
.PP
e-up\*(TX (\fBeuptex\fR) is a merge of e-\*(TX and up\*(TX.
.PP
In the following sections, we refer to these engines as (e-)(u)p\*(TX.
.PP
(e-)(u)p\*(TX's handling of its command-line arguments is similar to
that of the other \*(TX programs in the
.I web2c
implementation.
