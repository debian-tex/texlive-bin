ChkTeX
======

ChkTeX is a tool to check for common errors in LaTeX files.  It also
supports checking CWEB files (uses a perl5 script).  It is highly
customizable allowing you turn off any warnings you don't like, as
well as add your own warnings.  It works easily with Emacs and AUCTeX,
but should also be easy to interface with other editors.  If you have
interfaced ChkTeX with another editor, please contribute how you did
it.

It is important to remember that ChkTeX is only intended as a *guide*
to fixing faults.  It is by no means always correct.  This means that
correct LaTeX code may produce errors in ChkTeX, and vice versa:
incorrect LaTeX code may pass silently through.  If you have ideas for
new warnings or ways in which current warnings could be improved,
please report them on the
[bug tracker](https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=chktex).

For complete documentation see [the manual](http://www.nongnu.org/chktex/ChkTeX.pdf).
