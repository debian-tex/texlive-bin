pdfTeX is an extended version of eTeX that can create PDF directly from
TeX source files and enhance the result of TeX typesetting with the help
of PDF. When PDF output is not selected, pdfTeX produces normal DVI
output, otherwise it produces PDF output that looks essentially
identical to the DVI output

An important aspect of this project was to investigate alternative
justification algorithms, resulting in the "microtypography" features of
margin kerning and font expansion.  This was inspired by Peter Karow's
and Hermann Zapf's work.

pdfTeX is integrated with the original e-TeX sources and Web2c.  It is
actively maintained, but stability is paramount now; only bug fixes and
small enhancements are expected.  Releases are made through TeX Live.

See the file NEWS for changes to the program.
