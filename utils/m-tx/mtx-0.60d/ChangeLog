   Newest items at top

Version 0.60d
  Replaced space character tie label by no label,
  status.pas: procedure labelSlur, call procedure insertchar only for slurs.

Version 0.60c
  Added facility for prefixing music words with '_' for handling in PMX.
  Prefix is stripped in output file.

	       procedure GetNextMusWord.

Version 0.60b
  Fixed bug in doPMXpreamble causing errors with printed meters.

Version 0.60a 
  Fix for music size 13 in preamble.pas.
  Convert M-Tx denominators '1', '16', '32' and '64' 
  to PMX meter denominator syntax '0', '1', '3' and '6'. 
  {} ties don't get PMX label T attached in order to support MIDI ties.

Planned for the near future
  Accepts detached shortcut.

Version 0.55h (not released)
  Traces pitch including z-words; warns if unreal.  Disable checkPitch
  to bypass this.

Version 0.55g (not released)
  Corrects another bug in notes.pas, introduced at 0.55d.
  Features: countMacro, expandMacro. 

Version 0.55f (not released)
  Corrects bugs, mainly in notes.pas, introduced at 0.55d.
  Help via command line.

Version 0.55e (not released)
  Chord ties.  E.g.  C: {ce cf  ties the c.  No close-tie symbol.

Version 0.55d (not released)
  Mainly code cleanup.  Should be transparent to most users.    

Version 0.55c
  Corrects continuation slur bug.

Version 0.55b
  Bug correction, but including a substantial rewrite of the lyrics melisma handling.

Version 0.55
  Basically the same as 0.54k.

Version 0.54k (not released)
  DPL: Slurs are no longer translated to s and t, but to ( and {.  This requires
  PMX 2.502.  Labels are inserted into slurs.  

Version 0.54j (not released)
  DPL: "Enable" and "Disable" directives for more flexible handling of optional
  features.  No further development of "Options:" will be made.

Version 0.54h (not released)
  Certain parts of the unwieldy "globals" unit moved to a new "utility" unit.
  Affects programming, not functionality.

Version 0.54g (released only to beta testers)
  DPL: Corrected bug in multfile.pas (end-of-input not properly recognized).

Version 0.54f (released only to beta testers)
  DPL: Cleaning up of files.pas to take full advantage of the new
    multifile.pas unit.  Corrected some obscure bugs.

Version 0.54e (not released)

2004-03-07
  DPL: Added the "Include: filename" directive.  This may appear anywhere,
    and diverts the input stream to the new filename.  This may in turn
    include other files, etc.  A file may be included more than once, but
    do not try recursive includes!  When the end of an included file is
    reached, the stream reverts to the previous file.  End-of-file is
    treated seamlessly and does not act as a paragraph separator.

Version 0.54d (not released)

2004-02-15
  DPL: {...} gives st slurs, }{ works, -t option to retain old behaviour,
    some cleaning up of unused pieces of code.  
    Affects files.pas, globals.pas, mtxline.pas, preamble.pas, prepmx.pas,
      status.pas
