.SH "NAME"
dvisvgm \- converts DVI files to the XML\-based SVG format
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBdvisvgm\fR [ \fIoptions\fR ] \fIfile\fR [\&.dvi]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The command\-line utility \fBdvisvgm\fR converts DVI files, as generated by TeX/LaTeX, to the XML\-based scalable vector graphics format SVG\&. Since the current SVG standard 1\&.1 doesn\(cqt specify multi\-page graphics, dvisvgm creates separate SVG files for each DVI page\&. Because of compatibility reasons, only the first page is converted by default\&. In order to select a different page or arbitrary page sequences, use option \fB\-p\fR which is described below\&.
.sp
dvisvgm should properly convert all pages that are made up of fonts and rules only\&. However, the utility also supports a couple of DVI extensions defined in terms of \fIDVI specials\fR\&. For a more detailed overview, see section \fBsupport of specials\fR below\&.
.sp
As SVG is a vector based graphics format, dvisvgm tries to convert the glyph outlines of all used fonts into scalable path descriptions\&. The fastest way to do that is to extract the path information from PFB (PostScript Type 1) files\&. So, if dvisvgm is able to find a PFB file for a required font, it will read the necessary information from this file\&.
.sp
TeX\(cqs main source for font descriptions is Metafont though, which produces bitmap output\&. That\(cqs why not all obtainable TeX fonts are available in PFB format\&. In these cases, dvisvgm tries to vectorize Metafont\(cqs output (GF fonts) by tracing the glyph bitmaps\&. The results are not as perfect as most (manually optimized) PFB outlines but are nonetheless really nice in most cases\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-a, \-\-trace\-all\fR=[\fIretrace\fR]
.RS 4
This option forces dvisvgm to trace not only the actually needed glyphs but all glyphs of all bitmap fonts used in the DVI file\&. Since the tracing results are stored in the font cache, all following DVI conversions (without option
\fB\-\-trace\-all\fR) where these fonts are involved, will be much faster\&. By default, dvisvgm traces only the actually needed glyphs, and adds them to the cache\&. The boolean option
\fIretrace\fR
determines how to handle glyphs already stored in the cache\&. By default, these glyphs are skipped\&. Setting argument
\fIretrace\fR
to
\fIyes\fR
or
\fItrue\fR
forces dvisvgm to trace the corresponding bitmaps again\&.

cannot be combined with option

.RE
.PP
\fB\-b, \-\-bbox\fR=\fIfmt\fR
.RS 4
Sets the bounding box of the generated graphic to the specified format\&. The parameter
\fIfmt\fR
takes either one of the format specifiers listed below, or a sequence of four comma\- or whitespace\-separated length values
\fIx1\fR,
\fIy1\fR,
\fIx2\fR
and
\fIy2\fR\&. The latter define two diagonal corners of the bounding box\&. Each length value consists of a floating point number and an optional length unit (pt, bp, cm, mm, in, or pc)\&. If the unit is omitted, TeX points (pt) are assumed\&.
.sp
It\(cqs also possible to give only one length value
\fIl\fR\&. In this case, the minimal bounding box is computed and enlarged by adding (\-\fIl\fR,\-\fIl\fR) to the upper left and (\fIl\fR,\fIl\fR) to the lower right corner\&.
.sp
Alternatively, the following format specifiers are supported:

\fBPage orientation\fR
.RS 4
The default page orientation for DIN/ISO and American paper sizes is
\fIportrait\fR, i\&.e\&.
\fIwidth\fR
<
\fIheight\fR\&. Appending
\fB\-landscape\fR
or simply
\fB\-l\fR
to the format string switches to
\fIlandscape\fR
mode (\fIwidth\fR
>
\fIheight\fR)\&. For symmetry reasons you can also explicitly add
\fB\-portrait\fR
or
\fB\-p\fR
to indicate the default portrait format\&. Note that these suffixes are part of the size string and not separate options\&. Thus, they must directly follow the size specifier without additional blanks\&. Furthermore, the orientation suffixes can\(cqt be used with
\fBdvi\fR,
\fBmin\fR, and
\fBnone\fR\&.

\fB\-c, \-\-scale\fR=\fIsx\fR[,\fIsy\fR]
.RS 4
Scales the page content horizontally by

\fB\-TS\fR\fIsx\fR,\fIsy\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-C, \-\-cache\fR[=\fIdir\fR]
.RS 4
To speed up the conversion process of bitmap fonts, dvisvgm saves intermediate conversion information in cache files\&. By default, these files are stored in $HOME/\&.dvisvgm/cache\&. If you prefer a different location, use option
\fB\-\-cache\fR
to overwrite the default\&. Furthermore, it is also possible to disable the font caching mechanism completely with option
\fB\-\-cache=none\fR\&. If argument
\fIdir\fR
is omitted, dvisvgm prints the path of the default cache directory and some information about the stored fonts\&. Additionally, outdated and corrupted cache files are removed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-color\fR
.RS 4
Enables colorization of messages printed during the conversion process\&. The colors can be customized via the environment variable
DVISVGM_COLORS\&. See the ENVIRONMENT section below for further information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e, \-\-exact\fR
.RS 4
If this option is given, dvisvgm computes the precise bounding box of each character\&. By default, the values stored in a font\(cqs TFM file are used to determine a glyph\(cqs extent\&. As these values are intended to realize optimal character placements and are not designed to represent the exact dimensions, they don\(cqt necessarily correspond with the bounds of the visual glyphs\&. Thus, width and/or height of some glyphs may be larger than the respective TFM values\&. As a result, this can lead to clipped characters at the bounds of the SVG graphic\&. With option
\fB\-\-exact\fR, dvisvgm analyzes the actual shape of each character and derives a usually tight bounding box\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Prints a short summary of all available command\-line options\&. This is also the default action if dvisvgm is called without parameters\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-libgs=filename\fR
.RS 4
This option is only available if the Ghostscript library is not directly linked to dvisvgm and if PostScript support was not completely disabled during compilation\&. In this case, dvisvgm tries to load the shared GS library dynamically during runtime\&. By default, it expects the library\(cqs name to be libgs\&.so (on Unix\-like systems) or gsdll32\&.dll (Windows)\&. Option
\fB\-\-libgs\fR
can be used to give a different name\&. Alternatively, it\(cqs also possible to set the GS library name by the environment variable
LIBGS\&. The latter has less precedence than the command\-line option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l, \-\-list\-specials\fR
.RS 4
Prints a list of registered special handlers and exits\&. Each handler processes a set of special statements belonging to the same category\&. In most cases, the categories are identified by the prefix of the special statements\&. It\(cqs usually a leading word separated from the rest of the statement by a colon or a blank, e\&.g\&.
\fIcolor\fR
or
\fIps\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-keep\fR
.RS 4
Disables the removal of temporary files as created by Metafont (usually \&.gf, \&.tfm, and \&.log files)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m, \-\-map\-file\fR=\fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Sets the map file used to look up font names and encodings\&. dvisvgm does not provide its own map file but tries to read available ones coming with dvips or dvipdfm\&. If option
\fB\-m\fR
is not given, dvisvgm looks for
ps2pk\&.map,
dvipdfm\&.map, and
psfonts\&.map
(in this order)\&. Without further options, the file specified by option
\fB\-m\fR
will be used instead of the default maps\&. If you want dvisgvm to load the given file additionally to the default maps, add a leading
\fI+\fR
to the file/path, e\&.g\&.
\-\-map\-file=+myfonts\&.map\&. For further information about the map file formats, see the manuals of dvips and dvipdfm\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-M, \-\-mag\fR=\fIfactor\fR
.RS 4
Sets the maginfication factor applied in conjunction with Metafont calls prior tracing the glyphs\&. The larger this value, the better the tracing results\&. Nevertheless, large magnification values can cause Metafont arithmetic errors due to number overflows\&. So, use this option with care\&. The default setting usually produces nice results\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n, \-\-no\-fonts\fR[=\fIvariant\fR]
.RS 4
If this option is given, dvisvgm doesn\(cqt create SVG
\fIfont\fR
elements but uses
\fIpaths\fR
instead\&. The resulting SVG files tends to be larger but concurrently more compatible with most applications that don\(cqt support SVG fonts yet\&. The optional argument
\fIvariant\fR
selects the method how to substitute fonts by paths\&. Variant 0 creates
\fIpath\fR
and
\fIuse\fR
elements\&. Variant 1 creates
\fIpath\fR
elements only\&. Option
\fB\-\-no\-fonts\fR
implies
\fB\-\-no\-styles\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-S, \-\-no\-specials\fR[=\fInames\fR]
.RS 4
Disable processing of special commands embedded in the DVI file\&. If no further parameter is given, all specials are ignored\&. To selectively disable sets of specials, an optional comma\-separated list of names can be appended to this option\&. A
\fIname\fR
is the unique identifier referencing the intended special handler\&. Option
\fB\-\-list\-specials\fR
lists all currently available handlers and their names\&. All unsupported special statements are silently ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-styles\fR
.RS 4
By default, dvisvgm creates CSS styles and class attributes to reference fonts because it\(cqs more compact than repeatedly set the complete font information in each text element\&. However, if you prefer direct font references, the default behavior can be disabled with option
\fB\-\-no\-styles\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-mktexmf\fR
.RS 4
Suppresses the generation of missing font files\&. If dvisvgm can\(cqt find a font file through the kpathsea lookup mechanism, it calls the external tools mktextfm or mktexmf by\&. This option disables these calls\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o, \-\-output\fR=\fIpattern\fR
.RS 4
Sets the name pattern of the output file\&. Parameter
\fIpattern\fR
is a string that may contain the variables
\fB%f\fR
and
\fB%p\fR\&.
\fB%f\fR
stands for the base name of the DVI file, i\&.e\&. the DVI filename without suffix, and
\fB%p\fR
is the current page number\&. The default pattern is
\fB%f\-%p\&.svg\fR
if the DVI file consists of more than one page, and
\fB%f\&.svg\fR
otherwise\&. That means, a DVI file
\fIfoo\&.dvi\fR
is converted to
\fIfoo\&.svg\fR
if
\fIfoo\&.dvi\fR
is a single\-page document\&. Otherwise, multiple SVG files
\fIfoo\-01\&.svg\fR,
\fIfoo\-02\&.svg\fR, etc\&. are produced\&. In Windows environments, the percent sign indicates dereferenced environment variables, and must therefore be protected by a second percent sign, e\&.g\&.
\fB\-\-output=%%f\-%%p\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p, \-\-page\fR=\fIranges\fR
.RS 4
This option sets the pages to be processed\&. Parameter
\fIranges\fR
consists of a comma\-separated list of single page numbers and/or page ranges\&. A page range is a pair of numbers separated by a hyphen, e\&.g\&. 5\-12\&. Thus, a page sequence might look like this: 2\-4,6,9\-12,15\&. It doesn\(cqt matter if a page is given more than once or if page ranges overlap\&. dvisvgm always extracts the page numbers in ascending order and converts them only once\&. In order to stay compatible with previous versions, the default page sequence is 1\&. dvisvgm therefore converts only the first page and not the whole document in case option
\fB\-\-page\fR
is omitted\&. Usually, page ranges consist of two numbers denoting the first and last page to be converted\&. If the conversion is to be started at page 1, or if it should continue up to the last DVI page, the first or second range number can be omitted, respectively\&. Example:
\fB\-\-page=\-10\fR
converts all pages up to page 10,
\fB\-\-page=10\-\fR
converts all pages starting with page 10\&. Please consider that the page values don\(cqt refer to the page numbers printed on the page\&. Instead, the physical page count is expected, where the first page always gets number 1\&.
.RE

Defines or resets a local bounding box called

While processing a DVI page, dvisvgm continuously updates the (global) bounding box of the current page in order to determine the minimal rectangle containing all visible page components (characters, images, drawing elements etc\&.) Additionally to the global bounding box, the user can request an arbitrary number of named local bounding boxes\&. Once defined, these boxes are updated together with the global bounding box starting with the first character that follows the definition\&. Thus, the local boxes can be used to compute the extent of parts of the page\&. This is useful for scenarios where the generated SVG file is post\-processed\&. In conjunction with special dvisvgm:raw, the macro
\fB{?bbox \fR\fB\fIname\fR\fR\fB}\fR
expands to the four values
\fIx\fR,
\fIy\fR,
\fIw\fR, and
\fIh\fR
(separated by spaces) specifying the coordinates of the upper left corner, width, and height of the local box
\fIname\fR\&. If box

Updates the bounding box of the current page by embedding a virtual rectangle (\fIx\fR,
\fIy\fR,
\fIwidth\fR,
\fIheight\fR) where the lower left corner is located at the current DVI drawing position (\fIx\fR,\fIy\fR)\&. If the optional parameter
\fIdepth\fR
is specified, dvisvgm embeds a second rectangle (\fIx\fR,
\fIy\fR,
\fIwidth\fR, \-\fIdepth\fR)\&. The lengths
\fIwidth\fR,
\fIheight\fR
and
\fIdepth\fR
must be given as plain floating point numbers in TeX point units (1in = 72\&.27pt)\&. Depending on size and position of the virtual rectangle, this command either enlarges the overall bounding box or leaves it as is\&. It\(cqs not possible to reduce its extent\&. This special should be used in conjunction with
\fBdvisvgm:raw\fR
in order to update the viewport of the page properly\&.

This variant of the bbox special updates the bounding box by embedding a virtual rectangle (\fIx1\fR,\fIy1\fR,\fIx2\fR,\fIy2\fR)\&. The points (\fIx1\fR,\fIy1\fR) and (\fIx2\fR,\fIy2\fR) denote two diagonal corners of the rectangle given in TeX point units\&.

This variant of the bbox special assigns an absolute (final) bounding box to the resulting SVG\&. After executing this command, dvisvgm doesn\(cqt further alter the bounding box coordinates, except this special is called again later\&.

These specials were introduced with the emTeX distribution by Eberhard Mattes\&. They provide line drawing statements, instructions for embedding MSP, PCX, and BMP image files, as well as two PCL commands\&. dvisvgm supports only the line drawing statements and ignores all other em specials silently\&. A description of the command syntax can be found in the DVI driver documentation coming with emTeX (see CTAN)\&.
.RE

\fBps\fR
.RS 4
The famous DVI driver dvips introduced its own set of specials in order to embed PostScript code into DVI files, which greatly improves the capabilities of DVI documents\&. One aim of dvisvgm is to completely evaluate all PostScript snippets and to convert a large amount of it to SVG\&. However, in contrast to dvips, dvisvgm uses floating point arithmetics to compute the precise position of each graphic element, i\&.e\&. it doesn\(cqt round the corrdinates\&. Therefore, the relative locations of the graphic elements may slightly differ from those computed by dvips\&.
.sp
Since PostScript is a rather complex language, dvisvgm does not try to implement its own PostScript interpreter but relies on Ghostscript instead\&. If the Ghostscript library was not linked while building dvisvgm, it is looked up and dynamically loaded during runtime\&. In this case, dvisvgm looks for
\fIlibgs\&.so\fR
on Unix\-like systems, and for
\fIgsdll32\&.dll\fR
on Windows\&. You can override these default file names with the environment variable
LIBGS\&. The library must be installed and must be reachable through the ld search path (*nix) or the PATH environment variable (Windows)\&. If it cannot be found, the evaluation of PostScript specials is disabled\&. Use option
\fB\-\-list\-specials\fR
to check whether PS support is available, i\&.e\&. the entry
\fIps\fR
is present\&.

dvisvgm uses the \fBkpathsea\fR library for locating the files that it opens\&. Hence, the environment variables described in the library\(cqs documentation influence the converter\&.
.sp
If dvisvgm was linked without the Ghostscript library, and if PostScript support has not been disabled, the shared Ghostscript library is looked up during runtime via dlopen()\&. The environment variable LIBGS can be used to specify path and file name of the library\&.
.sp
The pre\-compiled Windows version of dvisvgm requires a working installation of MiKTeX 2\&.9 or above\&. To enable evaluation of PostScript specials, the original Ghostscript DLL \fIgsdll32\&.dll\fR must be present and reachable through the search path\&.
.sp
The environment variable DVISVGM_COLORS specifies the colors used to highlight various parts of dvisvgm\(cqs message output\&. It is only evaluated if option \fB\-\-color\fR is given\&. The value of DVISVGM_COLORS is a list of colon\-separated entries of the form \fIgg\fR=\fIBF\fR, where \fIgg\fR denotes one of the color group indicators listed below, and \fIBF\fR are two hexadecimal digits specifying the background (first digit) and foreground/text color (second digit)\&. The color color values are defined as follows: 0=black, 1=red, 2=green, 3=yellow, 4=blue, 5=magenta, 6=cyan, 7=gray, 8=bright red, 9=bright green, A=bright yellow, B=bright blue, C=bright magenta, D=bright cyan, E=bright gray, F=white\&. Depending on the terminal, the colors may differ\&. Rather than changing both the text and background color, it\(cqs also possible to change only one of them: An asterisk (*) in place of a hexadecimal digit indicates the default text or background color of the terminal\&.
.sp
All malformed entries in the list are silently ignored\&.
