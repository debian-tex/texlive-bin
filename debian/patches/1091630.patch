 \fBVPtoVF\fP is an extended version of the program \fBPLtoTF\fP,
-which is part of the standard TeXware library\&.  \fBOVP2OVF\fP is an
-extended version of \fBVPtoVF\fP that allows much larger fonts\&.  The
-idea of a virtual font was inspired by the work of David R\&. Fuchs who
-designed a similar set of conventions in 1984 while developing a
-device driver for ArborText, Inc\&.  He wrote a somewhat similar program
-called \fBPLFONT\fP\&.
