.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
\fBrubibtex\fP is used to run \fBbibtex\fP(1) on auxiliary files with
Russian characters in item names (citation keys)\&.  It is part of the
T2 package\&.
.PP 
\fBrubibtex\fP copies the auxiliary file to \fI/tmp\fP, uses
\fBsed\fP(1) to convert Cyrillic character commands to their 8-bit
ASCII equivalents; runs \fBbibtex\fP(1) on the modified file; and
finally moves the original auxiliary file back (overwriting the
modified file)\&.
.PP 
\fBrubibtex\fP assumes that the \fBbibtex\fP(1) database (\f(CWbib\fP)
files are encoded with the KOI8-R encoding\&.
