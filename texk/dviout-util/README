dviout-util
===========

This is a *partial* repackaging of elements of the DVIOUT package
by Toshio OSHIMA, Yoshiki OTOBE, and Kazunori ASAYAMA.
Here we don't include the main DVI previewer, but just want small utility
programs. Small description:

* chkdvifont[.exe]  : A utility to check font in DVI/TFM/JFM/FONT files
                      (formerly chkfont.exe; renamed due to name conflicts)
* chkdvifont-ja.txt : Document of chkdvifont.exe (in Japanese)
                      (formerly chkfont.txt)
* dvispc[.exe]   : A utility to correct the page-independence of DVI file
                   using color specials or tpic specials and
                   to transform between a DVI file and a text file
* dvispc-ja.txt  : A document of dvispc.exe (in Japanese)
                   (formerly dvispc.txt)
* dvispc-en.txt  : A document of dvispc.exe
                   (formerly dvispce.txt)

The followings are not (currently) added.

* propw[.exe]    : A utility to make jfm files for Japanese proportional font
* propw-ja.txt   : Document of propw.exe (in Japanese)
                   (formerly propw0.txt)


### License

This package is licensed under the Expat license. See COPYING for detail.
(Similar to the original DVIOUT package.)


### Repository

This package is maintained on GitHub for development.
  https://github.com/texjporg/tex-jp-build
  (under source/texk/dviout-util)

Please email any bug reports or problems to issue@texjp.org mailing list.


### Building dviout-util outside TeX Live

You can visit the GitHub repository
  https://github.com/aminophen/dviout-util
to obtain the standalone sources of dviout-util.

The files in 00texjporg/ are encoded in UTF-8 (LF) for Unix.
Other files are encoded in CP932 (LF) for Windows.

For Unix (GNU C; gcc, clang):

    $ cd dviout-util/00texjporg
    $ gcc -o chkdvifont -I.. chkdvifont.c
    $ gcc -o dvispc -I.. dvispc.c
    $ gcc -o propw -I.. propw.c

For Windows:

    $ cd dviout-util
    $ cl -O2 /MD -I. chkdvifont.c
    $ cl -O2 /MD -I. dvispc.c
    $ cl -O2 /MD -I. -DWIN32 propw.c /link gdi32.lib

The only difference from TeX Live version is that dvispc does not use
PTEXENC, which enables UTF-8 character printing.


### Character Encodings

The files in texlive subversion repository (under Build/source/texk/dviout-util)
  https://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/
are encoded in UTF-8 (LF).
The files in dviout subversion repository
  https://www.tug.org/svn/dviout/trunk/
are encoded in CP932 (LF), except for files inside distribution/ directory.

If you like to distribute the files (especially .txt documents) on
Windows, it might be better to convert LF to CRLF (CP932 should be kept):

    $ nkf -s -Lw --overwrite propw0.txt

The LF -> CRLF conversion is suggested in dviout subversion repository,
under distribution/ directory.
